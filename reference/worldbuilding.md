## Factions

### The Chandrian (The Seven)

**Members**:
1. Haliax (Lanre) - leader, shadow-wrapped
2. Cinder (Ferule) - pale, black eyes, sadistic
3. Five others (limited detail in books)

**Signs**: Each has a sign that marks their presence (fire dimming, rotting, etc.)

**The Truth** (our version):
- Not unified - Cinder is renegade
- Bound by an ancient curse
- If they die, something worse is released
- Haliax has been *containing* them, not commanding them

### The Amyr

**Official history**: Disbanded by the church centuries ago

**The Truth** (our version):
- Still active, hidden
- Have been *protecting* the Chandrian
- Containing them because the alternative is worse
- Members: Bredon, possibly Lorren, possibly Skarpi, Ben knew

**"For the greater good"**: The Amyr's motto takes on new meaning - they protect monsters to prevent apocalypse.

### The Sithe

**Description**: Fae guardians who kill anyone who speaks to the Cthaeh

**In Book 3**: May be hunting Kvothe (he spoke to the Cthaeh)

### The Church (Tehlinism)

**Description**: Dominant religion of the Four Corners

**In Book 3**: The Penitent King (Alveron) embraces the iron church to restore order after chaos.
