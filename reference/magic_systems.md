# Magic Systems Reference

Quick reference for the seven known magic systems plus the mysterious seventh.

---

## 1. Sympathy

**Basis**: Scientific, requires Alar (mental focus), bindings between objects

**Key concepts**:
- Alar: "Riding crop belief" - the unflinching certainty required
- Bindings: Link two objects so actions on one affect the other
- Slippage: Energy lost in transfer (heat, distance, material differences)
- Binder's chills: When your body becomes the energy source

**Common uses**:
- Binding coins for heat transfer
- Creating sympathetic links for tracking
- Emergency fire-starting
- Combat (heating blood, binding to heart)

**Limitations**:
- Requires focus and concentration
- More distance = more slippage
- Similar materials bind better
- Fatigue is real

**In Book 3**: Kvothe uses sympathy throughout, but it fails him when his belief fails (after the catastrophe).

## 2. Naming

**Basis**: Calling the true name of things grants power over them

**Key concepts**:
- Sleeping mind: The deep part that knows names
- Waking mind: Gets in the way
- Listening: The practice of perceiving deeply
- Speaking: The act of calling the name

**Known Names**:
- Wind (Kvothe knows this)
- Fire (Kvothe knows this)
- Stone
- Water
- Iron
- Silence (Kvothe uses this - the key moment)

**The Name of Silence**:
- Not a word - the absence of sound given shape
- Stops breath, stops vibration, stops everything
- This is what kills Denna and the King

**Limitations**:
- Cannot be forced or learned by rote
- The sleeping mind must choose to speak
- Dangerous - names have consequences

## 3. Sygaldry

**Basis**: Rune-based, permanent sympathy bindings

**Key concepts**:
- Runes inscribed on objects
- Creates lasting magical effects
- The basis of the University's artificing

**Common uses**:
- Ever-burning lamps
- Heat sinks (hand warmers)
- Bloodless (momentum redirector)
- Gram (malfeasance protection)

**In Book 3**: Established devices only. No new inventions.

---

## 4. Alchemy

**Basis**: Transformation of substances

**Key concepts**:
- Precise measurements and procedures
- Understanding of base materials
- Dangerous reactions possible

**Notable substances**:
- Bone-tar (extreme cold)
- Plum bob (dangerous compound)
- Denner resin (addictive, dangerous)

**In Book 3**: Devi's expertise may be relevant.

---

## 5. Grammarie (Fae Magic)

**Basis**: Making things "be more what they already are"

**Key concepts**:
- Enhances essential nature
- Works with what exists
- Subtle but powerful

**Examples**:
- Making a cloak more cloak-like (shaed)
- Making a person more themselves

**The Shaed**: Kvothe's shadow cloak, made by Felurian with grammarie.

---

## 6. Glamourie (Fae Magic)

**Basis**: Making things "appear other than they are"

**Key concepts**:
- Illusion and appearance
- Bast's specialty
- Can be seen through with iron or focus

**Uses**:
- Hiding Fae nature
- Appearing human
- Misdirection

---

## 7. Yllish Knots (Written Magic)

**Basis**: Written patterns that compel reality

**Key concepts**:
- Story knots that preserve meaning
- Can contain commands that must be obeyed
- Power comes from the writing itself

**Critical to Book 3**:
- Denna asks about this magic early in the series
- Her patron (Cinder) teaches her
- The Yllish knots in her hair
- The inscriptions carved into her skin
- Her song is Yllish magic made audible

**The Song's Power**:
- Rehabilitates Lanre/Chandrian in minds of listeners
- Each voice singing it strengthens the magic
- Designed to rewrite the ancient binding
- Shift power from Haliax to Cinder

---

## The Mysterious Eighth?

The seven types are listed, but there are hints of another:

**Possibilities**:
- The Singers/Tahl
- Whatever the Sithe do
- The Cthaeh's power (perfect future sight + malevolence)
- Old Knower magic (before the shapers)

---

## Magic in Action: Key Scenes

### The Name of Silence (Chapter 40)

Kvothe speaks the Name of Silence to stop Denna's song:
- Not a word but the absence of sound
- Takes Denna's breath (she is the song)
- Takes the King's heart (too close)
- Shatters Cinder's scheme

**Why this works narratively**:
- Foreshadowed: "I have stopped the breath of a woman"
- Kvothe knows Wind, Fire - Silence is their opposite
- He's aiming at the magic, hits the person

### Denna's Inscriptions

Cinder's "beatings" are actually Yllish writing:
- Each bruise is a binding
- Her skin becomes the parchment
- The song is written in her flesh
- She can't betray Cinder without the knots killing her

### The Thrice-Locked Chest

Built to contain Kvothe's name:
- Iron lock: Blocks Fae
- Copper lock: Blocks namers
- Third lock: Opens only for Kvothe

But Kvothe is gone. Only Kote remains.
The lock works against its maker.

## Rules to Follow

1. **No new magic systems** - Use what's established
2. **Consequences matter** - Magic has costs
3. **Cleverness over power** - Kvothe wins by thinking, not brute force
4. **Foreshadowing pays off** - Every magical moment should connect to earlier hints
