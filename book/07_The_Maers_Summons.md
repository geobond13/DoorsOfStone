THE LETTER ARRIVED on a grey morning, carried by a rider in the Maer's colors.

I was in the Fishery when they found me, elbow-deep in a delicate bit of sygaldry that required absolute concentration. Kilvin stood over me like a disappointed mountain, his massive arms folded across his chest.

"There is a messenger," he said. "From Vintas. He insists on speaking with you personally."

"I'm in the middle of—"

"He says it is urgent. He says the Maer Alveron is dying."

The piece I was working on—a heat sink of elegant design—slipped from my fingers and shattered on the workbench. I barely noticed.

"Dying?"

"That is what the messenger claims." Kilvin's expression was unreadable. "I will expect a report on your progress when you return, Re'lar. Assuming you return at all."

The messenger was young—barely older than me—with the desperate look of someone who had been riding too long on too little sleep. He pressed the letter into my hands without ceremony.

"The Maer requires your presence," he said. "Immediately. I have horses waiting."

"How bad is it?"

"Bad." The messenger's voice cracked. "The physicians say he has weeks. Maybe less. He's asked for you specifically. Says there are things you need to know before—" He stopped, swallowed. "Before the end."

I read the letter. It was brief, written in a hand I recognized—the Maer's own, though shakier than I remembered.

*Kvothe—*

*The poison runs deeper than either of us knew. I am dying, and there are doors that must be opened before I pass through the final one. Come quickly. There is much to discuss, and time grows short.*

*I have kept secrets from you. I regret that now. Perhaps when you understand, you will forgive an old man his caution.*

*Alveron*

I looked up at the messenger. "When do we leave?"

"Now, if you're ready. Sooner, if you can manage it."

The ride to Severen took four days at a pace that nearly killed the horses.

I had time to think during those long stretches of road. Too much time. The landscape blurred past—autumn fields giving way to foothills, foothills to mountains, mountains to the rolling green of Vintas—but I barely saw it. My mind was elsewhere.

Denna. Always Denna. I'd spent two spans searching for her after our fight, but she'd vanished as completely as if she'd never existed. Her rooms were empty. Her patrons knew nothing. Even the street musicians who tracked such things could only shrug and suggest she'd moved on.

But I didn't think she'd moved on. I thought she'd moved *in*. Deeper into whatever her patron was building. Deeper into the transformation I'd glimpsed in her eyes.

And now the Maer was dying, and there were secrets he needed to tell me, and I was running away from one catastrophe toward another.

*Some doors only close.*

Auri's words haunted me. Had I already closed the door on Denna? Was there still time to go back, to find her, to make things right?

But the Maer was dying. And the letter had spoken of doors that needed opening.

I kept riding.

Severen looked the same as I remembered—the gleaming spires of the upper city, the sprawling chaos of the lower, the Maer's estate crowning it all like a jewel set in stone. But there was something different in the air. A tension. A waiting quality, like the moment before a storm breaks.

The guards at the gate recognized me immediately.

"Re'lar Kvothe." The captain's voice was tight with relief. "Thank the Lord and Lady. He's been asking for you every hour."

"How bad?"

"See for yourself."

They led me through familiar corridors, past servants who moved with the hushed urgency of those tending the dying. The estate was quieter than I remembered—fewer courtiers, fewer games, fewer beautiful people playing their beautiful games.

The door to the Maer's chambers was guarded by six men in full armor. That was new.

"He's inside," the captain said. "With Lady Lackless."

My stomach tightened. Meluan. The woman who hated everything Edema Ruh. The woman who didn't know I was—

*Stop*, I told myself. *Deal with that later.*

I pushed open the door.

---

The room smelled of sickness.

It was a subtle thing—masked by flowers and incense—but I recognized it immediately. The smell of a body giving up. The smell of an ending.

The Maer lay in a massive bed, propped up by pillows. He looked... diminished. The vital man I'd known—sharp-eyed and sharper-tongued—had become something fragile. Hollow. His skin had a yellowish tinge that no amount of fine bedding could disguise.

Meluan sat beside him, holding his hand. She looked up when I entered, and something flickered across her face—recognition, then something harder. Something that might have been suspicion.

"You came," the Maer said. His voice was a whisper of what it had been, but his eyes were still keen. Still dangerous. "I wasn't sure you would."

"You asked." I moved to the bedside, aware of Meluan's gaze tracking my every step. "I came."

"Good. Good." He gestured weakly to a chair. "Sit. We have much to discuss, and I tire easily these days."

I sat. Waited.

The Maer gathered himself. The effort it took was visible—a visible rallying of failing strength.

"The poisoning was not Caudicus's work," he said. "Or rather, not *only* his work. He was a tool. A catspaw. The real poison runs deeper."

"Who?"

"I don't know. That's part of what I need you to discover." He coughed—a wet, rattling sound that made Meluan flinch. "But I have suspicions. The Jakis family has been making moves. Ambrose's father has grown bolder since I fell ill. And there are others—" He coughed again. "Others who stand to gain if the Calanthis line fails."

"The King?"

"Roderic is strong. For now. But if both he and I were to fall..." The Maer's eyes met mine. "Vintas would tear itself apart. And someone would be waiting to pick up the pieces."

I thought of Ambrose. Of his father's wealth and connections. Of the way power shifted when old men died.

"Why tell me this?"

"Because you're the only one I trust who isn't already part of the game." The Maer smiled—a ghost of his old expression. "You have no family to leverage, no estates to threaten. You're brilliant and dangerous and completely unattached to any faction."

"I'm also just a student."

"You're also the man who saved my life once. Who charmed a Fae creature and walked out of the Eld alive." His smile faded. "And you're blood of the Lackless line, whether you know it or not."

The room went very still.

Meluan's hand tightened on the Maer's. Her face had gone pale.

"What did you say?" I asked.

"I said what I said." The Maer's eyes never left mine. "Your mother was Netalia Lackless. Meluan's sister. The one who ran away with a Ruh trouper and was never seen again."

I looked at Meluan. She was staring at me with an expression I couldn't read—horror and recognition and something that might have been grief, all tangled together.

"You knew," I said to her. "You figured it out."

"The first time we met." Her voice was barely audible. "You looked at me and... I saw her. My sister. In your eyes, in your face." She drew a shaking breath. "I've known who you were since the moment you walked into this court."

"And you didn't say anything."

"What was I supposed to say?" Her voice rose, sharp with old pain. "That my sister—my *sister*—abandoned her family for a *Ruh*? That she chose wandering and poverty and—" She stopped, visibly wrestling for control.

The Maer raised a hand. "Enough. The past is past. What matters now is the future." He looked at me. "You have a claim, Kvothe. A legitimate claim to the Lackless holdings. Not strong enough to take them by force, but strong enough to matter. To make you useful to certain people."

"What people?"

"The ones who've been watching you since you arrived at the University." The Maer's voice had grown quieter, his energy fading. "The ones who remove information from the Archives. Who pull strings from the shadows. Who have been guiding events for longer than you can imagine."

"The Amyr."

"Perhaps. Or something older." He gestured to Meluan. "Show him. Show him what you showed me."

Meluan stood. Her face was a mask of controlled emotion. "Follow me."

"Maer—"

"Go." He closed his eyes. "We'll speak more when you return. There's still so much you need to understand. About the doors. About what's really happening. About—" He trailed off, his breathing evening out into sleep.

Meluan was already at the door. "Come," she said. "I'll show you the family secret. The one we've kept for three thousand years."

I stood.

I followed.

And part of me knew—the same part that had known on the rooftop, the same part that always knew—that this was another door. Another point of no return.

But I walked through it anyway.

Because that's what I do.

"The Lackless door."

Chronicler's pen had stopped moving. "That was real? Not just legends?"

"It was real." The innkeeper's voice was flat. "A door sealed for three thousand years. Hidden in the oldest part of the Lackless estate, in a chamber that had been a secret for so long that even the family had forgotten what they were guarding."

"What was behind it?"

"Nothing." The innkeeper laughed—that hollow sound again. "Or everything. It depended on how you looked at it."

"I don't understand."

"Neither did I. Not at first." He picked up his cloth, began wiping the bar. "The Lackless door wasn't a door to somewhere. It was a door to *nothing*. A seal. A lock. And the Lackless family—my family, though I didn't want to claim them—had been the keepers of that lock for longer than history remembers."

Bast leaned forward. "The Doors of Stone."

"Part of them, yes. One lock among many." The innkeeper set down his cloth. "But Meluan showed me something else that day. Something that changed everything I thought I knew about my family. About myself. About what I was meant to do."

"What did she show you?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"The Lackless box," he said finally. "And what was inside it."
