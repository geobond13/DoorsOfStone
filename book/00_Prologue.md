## Notes for Writing

The prologue should mirror the opening of the previous books:

1. **First silence**: The obvious quiet - absence of patrons, music, life
2. **Second silence**: The deeper quiet - the weight of the inn itself
3. **Third silence**: The silence belonging to the man - cut-flower sound, waiting

**Key differences from previous prologues:**
- More tension - this is the final day
- Hints of what's to come
- Perhaps the silence is slightly different - cracking at the edges
- Bast's desperation should be palpable even in silence

**Opening line considerations:**
- Should feel familiar yet ominous
- The Waystone Inn at the edge of things
- A man with red hair waiting for something to begin - or end
