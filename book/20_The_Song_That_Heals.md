I WROTE FOR three days.

Not performed. Not practiced. Just wrote—notes and words and fragments of melody, trying to capture something that felt too large for music.

How do you sing a story that's been buried for three thousand years? How do you make people feel sympathy for a monster, humanity for a legend, truth for something they've only known as lies?

The answer, I realized, was that you don't try to tell the whole story. You tell one moment. One truth. One image so powerful that it reshapes everything around it.

Lanre, standing over Lyra's body. Not the destroyer of cities. Not the maker of the Chandrian. Just a man, holding the woman he loved, knowing she was gone forever.

That was the moment. That was the truth that could balance Denna's song.

"It's beautiful," Simmon said, when I finally played it for him.

We were in my room at the Maer's estate. Wil sat in the corner, his face unreadable. Simmon's eyes were wet.

"It's not finished," I said.

"No. But it's..." He struggled for words. "It's real. It doesn't feel like propaganda. It just feels like... like someone telling you what actually happened."

"That's the point." I set down the lute. "Denna's song works because it feels true. Because it gives people permission to believe something they want to believe—that villains are secretly heroes, that history has lied to them, that they're privy to hidden knowledge."

"And your song?"

"My song doesn't give them anything. It just shows them a man in pain." I looked at my hands. "I don't know if it's enough. I don't know if sympathy can counter worship."

"It can." Wil's voice was quiet. "Where I'm from, we have a saying: 'The god who bleeds is no god.' If you show people that Lanre suffered—truly suffered, like they suffer—then he becomes mortal in their minds. Mortal things can't be worshipped. Only pitied."

"You think it will work?"

"I think it has to." He stood. "We've been here a week, Kvothe. The Maer is dying. The doors are opening. Denna's song is spreading. We're running out of time."

"The Maer's poisoning—"

"Is coming from the door. You said so yourself. The only way to stop it is to seal the door, and the only way to seal the door is to counter the song." Wil's eyes met mine. "We need to get back to the University. We need to spread your song before it's too late."

He was right. I'd been hiding in composition, using the song as an excuse to delay the harder choices ahead.

"Tomorrow," I said. "We leave at dawn."

I found Meluan that night.

She was in the chapel again, not praying this time. Just sitting, staring at the ancient stones.

"You're leaving," she said, without turning.

"I have to. The answer to your husband's illness isn't here—it's at the University, in the sealed Archives, in knowledge that's been hidden for too long."

"And the song you've written?"

I hesitated. "You've heard?"

"The servants talk." She finally turned to face me. "They say you've been playing something beautiful. Something sad."

"It's meant to counter what Denna is singing. To balance the narrative."

"Will it work?"

"I don't know." I sat in the pew across from her. "But I have to try. The conceptual seal is weakening. If I can strengthen it—"

"If." She looked away. "My whole life has been lived on 'if.' If my sister hadn't run away. If my family hadn't been cursed with this guardianship. If I'd understood earlier what we were protecting."

"You did what you could."

"Did I?" Her voice was bitter. "I spent years hating Netalia for abandoning her duty. And now I learn that she was running toward something, not away. That she understood what I never did—that the guardianship wasn't a burden to be endured, but a war to be fought."

"She fought in her own way."

"And lost." Meluan's eyes were wet. "They killed her, Kvothe. The Chandrian killed my sister because she knew too much. And I spent fifteen years cursing her memory, never knowing what she'd sacrificed."

I didn't have words for that kind of guilt. Didn't have comfort to offer.

"She would have been proud of you," I said finally. "For keeping the box safe. For continuing the guardianship even without understanding it."

"Would she?" Meluan shook her head. "I think she would have been disappointed. I had decades to learn what she knew. Instead, I spent them hating the Ruh and ignoring my responsibilities."

"Then make up for it now. Help me fight."

"How? I'm not a Namer. I'm not a musician. I'm just a woman with a box and a legacy I barely understand."

"The box." I leaned forward. "Bredon told me the seals require specific components. Physical locks, magical bindings, conceptual barriers. The box contains keys—keys that might work on more than one level."

"You want to use them?"

"I want to understand them. To study them. To see if they can help reinforce what's failing."

Meluan was quiet for a long moment.

"Take the box," she said finally. "Take it to the University. Study it, use it, do whatever you need to do." She met my eyes. "But Kvothe—if you fail, if the doors open and everything falls apart—"

"Then the box won't matter anyway."

"No." She reached out, touched my hand. "If everything falls apart, you need to run. Don't try to save anyone. Don't try to be a hero. Just run as far and as fast as you can, and hope that something survives."

"I don't run from fights."

"This isn't a fight you can win. If the doors open fully, if what's behind them gets free—" She shuddered. "My family's records are very clear about one thing: if the seals fail completely, nothing in this world can stop what follows. Nothing."

I left Severen at dawn with my lute, my songs, and the Lackless box.

Simmon and Wil rode beside me, their faces grim. None of us spoke much. We all understood what was waiting—the University, the Archives, the truths that had been hidden for far too long.

And somewhere, Denna. Still singing her song. Still being written by Cinder. Still waiting for me to save her or fight her or both.

As we rode, I hummed the melody I'd composed. The song of Lanre—not the destroyer, but the man. The human behind the legend.

*He held her close as darkness fell*
*The woman who was gone*
*And in that moment, heaven and hell*
*Were lost, and he alone*

It wasn't complete. Wasn't polished. But it was true. And truth, I'd learned, was the oldest magic there was.

---

We stopped in a small town on the fifth day.

There was an inn with a common room, travelers gathered for evening meal. Music playing—a local man with a fiddle, not skilled but enthusiastic.

"You should play," Simmon said.

"It's not ready."

"It doesn't have to be ready. It just has to be heard." He nodded toward the gathered crowd. "These people will talk. They'll tell others. A song spreads one voice at a time."

"Denna's song has been spreading for months. Mine has been alive for less than a week."

"Then you'd better start now." Wil's voice was pragmatic. "The race is already underway. Sitting at the starting line won't help you catch up."

I looked at my lute. At the crowd. At the fiddler finishing his song to polite applause.

Then I stood and walked to the front of the room.

"My name is Kvothe," I said, as the conversations quieted. "I'm a student from the University. And I'd like to play you something I've written."

They weren't expecting what I gave them.

I started with the ending, not the beginning. Lanre holding Lyra's body. The grief that broke a man. The loss that unmade a hero.

I sang of love that couldn't accept death. Of desperate measures and terrible bargains. Of a man who traded everything—his name, his face, his humanity—for one more moment with the woman he'd lost.

I sang of what he found when he brought her back. How death had changed her. How she'd begged him to let go.

And I sang of his refusal. The curse that bound him. The eternity of wandering, seeking something that could never be restored.

By the end, the room was silent.

Then a woman in the front row began to cry.

"That's not how the story goes," a man said from the back. "The Chandrian are villains. They destroyed cities."

"They did." I didn't argue with him. "Lanre destroyed seven cities and killed thousands of people. That's part of the story too."

"Then why sing about his pain?"

"Because understanding evil doesn't mean excusing it. It means recognizing that monsters start as men. That tragedy creates more tragedy. That the line between hero and villain is drawn by the choices we make in our worst moments."

The man was quiet.

"I've heard another song about Lanre," someone else said. "It says he was betrayed. That the Chandrian were protecting people from something worse."

"I've heard that song too." I set down my lute. "And I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm saying that truth is more complicated than any single story. Lanre loved Lyra. Lanre lost Lyra. And everything that followed—the destruction, the binding, the three thousand years of conflict—all of it grew from that one moment of grief."

"So what's the truth?"

"The truth is that love breaks us as often as it saves us. That power corrupts even the noblest intentions. That the greatest tragedies aren't caused by evil, but by people trying to hold onto something they can't bear to lose."

The room was silent again.

Then the fiddler raised his bow.

"Play it again," he said. "I want to learn the melody."

---

We left the town the next morning with the song already spreading behind us.

By the time we reached the University, I would learn later, it had reached three other towns. By the time I entered the Archives, it had crossed into Atur. By the time I found what I was looking for in the restricted stacks, people were singing it in Renere.

The race was on.

And for the first time in weeks, I felt something like hope.
