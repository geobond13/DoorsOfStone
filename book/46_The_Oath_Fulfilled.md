PEACE DOESN'T LAST.

I should have known that. Did know it, somewhere beneath the relief of returning home. But I let myself pretend otherwise for a few months. Let myself believe that the worst was over.

It wasn't.

The first sign came from Ambrose.

Not directly—he was too careful for that. But rumors began circulating. Stories about me. About what I'd done in Renere. About the magical explosion that had killed hundreds and left the great hall in ruins.

"They're calling you a terrorist," Simmon said, his face pale. "There are warrants being issued. The Maer's people are asking questions."

"The Maer knows what happened."

"The Maer is dead." Simmon's voice cracked. "Three weeks ago. The poisoning finally finished him."

I felt the words like a blow.

"Alveron is dead?"

"And Meluan is blaming you. Saying you conspired with the dark forces that attacked the ball. That you're responsible for everything." He gripped my arm. "Kvothe, they're coming for you. There's a bounty on your head—a thousand talents, dead or alive."

"I saved the world."

"No one knows that. All they know is what they saw—explosions, death, a man at the center of it all who disappeared before anyone could question him." Simmon shook his head. "The narrative has already been written. And you're the villain."

The second sign came from Cinder.

Not in person—I hadn't seen him since the mountain. But his influence was spreading. Villages touched by silence. Towns where music no longer worked. A creeping wrongness that ate at the edges of the world.

"He's building something," Devi said, studying the patterns I'd described. "A network. A web of silence that spans the Four Corners."

"Why?"

"I don't know. But if I had to guess—he's preparing for another attempt. The doors are sealed, but seals can be weakened. Given enough time, enough pressure..."

"They break."

"Everything breaks eventually." She looked at me. "Including you, if you keep carrying that silence without understanding it."

"I understand it better than before."

"Do you? Or have you just learned to coexist with it?" Her voice was sharp. "The silence you carry isn't stable, Kvothe. It's connected to the seal, to Denna, to the doors themselves. If Cinder finds a way to exploit that connection—"

"Then he has access to everything I have access to."

"Including the woman you love." Devi's eyes were hard. "You need to figure out what you're going to do. Before he figures it out for you."

The third sign was the worst.

It came at night, in the Underthing, where I'd gone to speak with Auri. She was waiting for me in Mantle, as always. But something was wrong.

Her eyes were hollow. Her movements were slow. And wrapped around her wrists, barely visible in the candlelight, were patterns I recognized.

Yllish knots.

"No," I breathed. "No, no, no—"

"He found me." Her voice was distant. "Through the paths I use. Through the doors between places." She looked at me with terrible calm. "He said to tell you: the first of three things breaks tonight."

"Auri, what did he do to you?"

"He wrote on me. Like he wrote on her." She touched the knots on her wrists. "But I'm not a bridge. I'm not a channel. I'm just..." She struggled for words. "A message. A warning. A demonstration of what he can do."

"I'll break the binding. I know how—"

"Too late." She began walking toward the deeper darkness. "The first thing is already broken. The second follows. And then the third."

"What things? What are you talking about?"

She stopped at the edge of the light.

"Your oath," she said. "To protect the innocent. To save those who couldn't save themselves. To be the hero the stories claim."

Then she stepped into the shadows.

And was gone.

---

I searched for hours.

The Underthing was vast—miles of tunnels, countless chambers, doors that led to places I'd never seen. But Auri knew its paths better than anyone. If she didn't want to be found...

I returned to the surface at dawn, empty-handed and desperate.

Simmon was waiting.

"She's gone," I said, before he could speak. "Cinder took her. Marked her with the same patterns he used on Denna."

"There's more." His face was ashen. "While you were underground—news came from Vintas. Meluan has declared you an enemy of the realm. She's offering ten thousand talents for your capture."

"I don't care about—"

"And Kilvin is dead."

The world stopped.

"What?"

"An accident. An explosion in the Artificery." Simmon's voice shook. "He was working on something—protective equipment, he said, in case you needed to face Cinder again. Something went wrong. The whole workshop..."

"That's not an accident."

"No. It isn't." Simmon met my eyes. "The first of three things. Auri, marked and vanished. Kilvin, dead in an explosion. What's the third, Kvothe? What else does he want to take from you?"

I didn't know.

But I was going to find out.

---

The answer came that evening.

I was in my room at Anker's, preparing to leave—where, I didn't know. Just away. Away from the University that couldn't protect me anymore. Away from the friends who were becoming targets.

There was a knock at the door.

I opened it.

Wil stood there, a letter in his hand. His face was the color of old parchment.

"This came for you," he said. "Delivered by a messenger who wouldn't say who sent him."

I took the letter. Broke the seal.

*The third thing you swore to protect,* it read, *is already mine. The woman you called mother died thinking of you. The woman you call friend disappears into darkness. And the woman you love is trapped in a seal of my design.*

*Three oaths. Three breaks. Three prices for your interference.*

*Come to me, Kvothe. Or watch everyone you care about suffer for your choices.*

*—Ferule*

I read it twice.

Then I looked at Wil.

"He has Denna," I said. "Not her body—she is the seal. But somehow, he's found a way to hurt her. To reach her through the binding."

"What are you going to do?"

I thought of Auri, marked and running. Of Kilvin, dead in an explosion that shouldn't have happened. Of Denna, trapped between worlds, suffering because of me.

"What I should have done from the beginning," I said. "Face him. End this. Whatever it costs."

I gathered what I needed.

And I walked toward the door.

Toward Cinder.

Toward the end of everything.
