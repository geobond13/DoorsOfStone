THE LETTER ARRIVED three days after my confrontation with Denna.

It bore the Maer's seal—the silver and sapphire that marked correspondence from Alveron himself. The messenger who delivered it was road-worn and impatient, clearly under orders to wait for a reply.

I broke the seal in my room at Anker's, my hands steadier than my heart.

*To Kvothe, called the Arcane, called the Bloodless:*

*Your presence is required at Severen with all possible haste. Matters of grave importance have arisen—matters that concern your unique talents and your discretion.*

*Come prepared for extended stay. Trust no one with the contents of this letter.*

*Alveron*

Beneath the formal script, a postscript in a different hand:

*The situation is worse than he admits. Please hurry.*
*—Stapes*

I read it twice. Three times. The words remained the same, but their meaning shifted with each reading.

The Maer was in trouble. Serious trouble, if Stapes felt the need to add his own warning. And whatever that trouble was, Alveron believed I was the one who could help.

Part of me wanted to ignore it. I had my own problems—Denna, Cinder, the song that was slowly changing the world. The last thing I needed was to get tangled up in courtly politics again.

But another part of me recognized the opportunity. Severen meant access to the Lackless family. To Meluan, who hated me for my Ruh blood but who held secrets that might be the key to everything. To doors that had been closed for three thousand years.

And if the Cthaeh's words were true—if the Maer was "close to the Amyr's door"—then perhaps Severen was exactly where I needed to be.

I found Simmon and Wilem in the Taps that evening.

"I have to leave," I said, sliding into the seat across from them. "Tomorrow, probably. The Maer has summoned me."

Wil's eyebrows rose. "The Maer Alveron? The most powerful noble in Vintas?"

"That Maer, yes."

"And you're just... going to go?" Simmon's voice was skeptical. "After everything that's happening here? After Denna, and the song, and—"

"I don't have a choice." I kept my voice low. "Stapes added a note. Whatever's happening in Severen, it's urgent."

"It could be a trap," Wil said. "Ambrose's family has connections to the Vintish court. If they wanted to get you away from the University, away from witnesses—"

"Then they'd have to deal with me on their own ground." I smiled, but there was no humor in it. "I've survived the Maer's court before. I can do it again."

"That's not the point." Simmon leaned forward. "The point is, you're running away. Again. Every time things get complicated, you disappear to somewhere else."

"I'm not running away. I'm—"

"You're avoiding." His voice was sharp. "Denna is here. The answers you're looking for are here. But the moment things get difficult, the moment you might actually have to face something painful, you find an excuse to leave."

The words stung because they were partly true.

"The Maer's summons isn't an excuse," I said carefully. "It's a lead. Severen has connections to the Lackless family, to doors that have been sealed for millennia, to secrets that might explain everything."

"Or it's a distraction." Wil's voice was quiet. "The Cthaeh told you things designed to make you act. What if this is part of that? What if running to Severen is exactly what it wants you to do?"

I had no answer for that. Because the truth was, I didn't know. Every choice I made might be playing into the Cthaeh's design. Every decision might be leading me closer to the disaster it had foreseen.

But I couldn't simply freeze. Couldn't refuse to act because any action might be wrong.

"I have to try something," I said finally. "Sitting here, waiting for Denna's song to finish its work, waiting for Cinder to make his next move—that's not a plan. That's surrender."

Simmon and Wil exchanged glances.

"Then we're coming with you," Simmon said.

"What?"

"You heard me." His jaw was set. "You're not disappearing again. Not alone. If you're going to Severen, we're going too."

"That's not—you can't just leave the University—"

"Watch us." Wil's voice was calm. "We've been covering for you for months. A few more weeks won't make a difference."

"But your studies—"

"Are less important than keeping you from getting yourself killed." Simmon stood. "We leave tomorrow. I'll arrange horses."

He walked out before I could argue.

Wil finished his drink, set down the mug. "He's right, you know. You need people watching your back. And we've been doing that for years."

"I don't want to put you in danger."

"Too late for that." He smiled—rare for him, and therefore significant. "We've been in danger since we met you. At least this time, we get to choose the danger ourselves."

We left at dawn.

The road to Severen was long and uncertain—weeks of travel through countryside that grew stranger the further we went from the Commonwealth. The war hadn't reached this far yet, but signs of its approach were everywhere: refugees on the roads, soldiers in unfamiliar colors, whispered rumors of battles and betrayals.

I told them what I knew as we rode. Not everything—there were things I couldn't say, truths too dangerous to share even with friends. But enough. About the Cthaeh. About Denna and Cinder. About the song and the doors and the ancient conflict that was slowly tearing the world apart.

They listened without interrupting. Asked questions when I finished. And when I had no answers, they simply nodded and kept riding.

"So the Chandrian might not be what we think they are," Simmon said, on our fifth day out. "They might be... guardians?"

"I don't know. That's what some sources suggest. But other sources say they're exactly what the stories claim—monsters who destroyed cities and killed innocents."

"Both could be true," Wil said thoughtfully. "Guard something for three thousand years, and you might become a monster in the process. Especially if the thing you're guarding is terrible enough to require such extreme measures."

"That's a cheerful thought."

"It's a realistic thought." He urged his horse over a rough patch of road. "Nothing stays pure forever. Not people, not institutions, not even purposes. Time corrupts everything."

I thought of my parents. Of the song my mother used to sing, the one that had gotten them killed. Of the way stories changed as they passed from mouth to mouth, losing truth and gaining legend.

"Then how do we know what's real?" I asked. "How do we know which version to believe?"

"We don't." Wil's voice was matter-of-fact. "We just do the best we can with incomplete information. Make choices based on what seems most likely to be true. And accept that we'll probably be wrong about some of it."

"That's not very comforting."

"Comfort is for children." He smiled grimly. "Adults live with uncertainty. That's what makes us adults."

We reached Severen on the eighteenth day.

The city was larger than I remembered—sprawling across the hills above the river, its white walls gleaming in the afternoon sun. But there was something different about it now. A tension in the air. Guards at every gate. Soldiers patrolling streets that had been peaceful a year ago.

"Something's wrong," Simmon said quietly.

"Yes." I could feel it too—the same wrongness I'd sensed in the Cthaeh's tree, the same pressure that preceded disaster. "Something's very wrong."

We made our way to the Maer's estate. The gates opened for us—my name was on a list, apparently, along with "companions if accompanied." Alveron had anticipated that I wouldn't come alone.

Stapes met us in the courtyard. He looked older than I remembered. Worn. The perpetual worry in his eyes had deepened into something closer to fear.

"Thank the gods you came," he said, gripping my hand. "The Maer... he's not well. The poisoning—"

"I thought Caudicus was dealt with."

"He was." Stapes glanced around, lowered his voice. "But someone else has taken up where he left off. Someone inside the estate. Someone we can't identify."

"How long?"

"Months. It started shortly after you left." He led us toward the main building. "We've changed his food. Changed his servants. Changed everything we could think of. Nothing helps. He gets weaker every day."

"And you think I can find the poisoner?"

"I think you're the only one who might." Stapes paused at the door. "But that's not the only reason he summoned you. There's something else. Something Meluan discovered in the old Lackless estate."

My heart beat faster. "What kind of something?"

"A door." His voice was barely audible. "A door that's been sealed for three thousand years. And somehow, it's starting to open."
