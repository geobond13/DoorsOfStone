THE FIRE HAD died while Kote was speaking.

Neither Chronicler nor Bast had moved to tend it. Outside, the darkness had grown deeper—that quality that comes before dawn, when the world holds its breath.

"And that's where I've been," Kote said quietly. His voice was hoarse from hours of speaking. "For years now. Running an inn. Keeping silence. Waiting for something I can't name."

Chronicler shifted in his chair, fingers stained with ink. "But you could open the chest. If you wanted to."

"Could I?" Kote looked at the chest in the corner. "The keys don't exist. The conditions for opening aren't met. And even if they were—"

"You're afraid."

The word landed like a stone dropped into deep water.

For a long moment, Kote said nothing. When he spoke, his voice was barely a whisper.

"Yes. I'm afraid of what I might become if I released it."

"But the world needs—"

"The world doesn't know what it needs." Kote's voice sharpened—a flash of the man he'd been. "I spent years thinking I could fix things. Be the hero."

He shook his head. "I was wrong. Every time I reached for power, someone I loved paid the price."

Bast spoke from his corner.

His mood shifted like weather in the Fae—one moment still, the next a storm. He rose from his chair with that inhuman grace, his eyes catching the faint light in ways that reminded anyone watching that he was not, had never been, entirely human.

"That's not true." His voice cracked. "You sealed the doors. Stopped Cinder. Saved—"

"Saved what?" Kote turned to face him. "The woman I loved became a seal. The abilities I'd spent my whole life developing—gone."

He held up his hands—the hands that had once played music that moved audiences to tears.

"I'm not a hero, Bast. I'm a warning."

Bast's expression flickered through three emotions in as many seconds—grief, fury, desperate hope—his Fae nature making him incapable of the steady composure humans wore like armor. He stepped forward, then flinched as his bare foot touched the iron nail that had worked loose from the floorboard. A hiss escaped him, and he kicked the nail away with more force than necessary.

"The man I see isn't a warning," Bast said, recovering himself, eyes wet but voice steadying. "He's someone who gave everything."

"There's nothing noble about giving when you have nothing left."

"Maybe enduring is enough." Bast's voice carried the weight of centuries—the particular patience of the Fae, who understood time differently than mortals. "My people have a saying: *The oak that bends in every storm outlasts the iron that breaks in one.*"

Kote looked at him for a long moment. "It doesn't feel like enough. It feels like the silence between notes in a song that never resolves."

---

Chronicler set down his pen.

"The story isn't finished," he said. "You're still here. Still connected to Denna."

"What difference does that make?"

"All the difference." Chronicler leaned forward. "The story you're telling—it's not about an ending. It's about a pause. The hero retreats. Learns. And then, when the time is right—"

"He comes back." Kote laughed bitterly. "A triumphant return?"

"I want the truth. Whatever that is."

"The truth is I don't know what comes next. I've been waiting for a sign, some reason to stop hiding. It hasn't come."

Outside, darkness was beginning to lighten—the first promise of dawn.

"Maybe you have to create it yourself," Chronicler said. "The reason to act."

He gestured at the chest. "The things locked inside—they're not just power. They're potential."

"Or to become something worse."

"Isn't that always the risk? That never stopped you before."

"Before, I had something to lose." Kote spread his hands. "Now I'm empty."

"There's always something left. Even silence can be shaped into meaning."

---

Bast was crying. Silent tears tracing paths through dust.

"Reshi," he said, voice cracking. "Open the chest. What are the conditions?"

Kote was quiet. The room was cold, the fire dead.

"The first lock opens when someone speaks my true name with full understanding," he said finally. "Not Kvothe—the identity beneath all the masks."

"And the second?"

"Opens when someone I love calls me back. With genuine need and genuine love."

"And the third?"

Kote hesitated. "The third opens when I stop being afraid. When I accept that the power might corrupt me—and choose to take it anyway."

"Three conditions," Chronicler said. "Three keys that aren't keys."

"Three doors that have stayed closed for years." Kote looked at the chest. "Because no one knows my true name. Because Denna can't call me—she's too scattered. And because I'm still afraid."

"Chronicler has been listening for three days," Bast said. "If anyone could understand—"

"True names aren't just knowledge. They're resonance. You can know everything and still miss the essence."

"No." Kote's voice was firm. "The chest stays locked. The story ends here—with waiting."

He walked behind the bar and began to wipe the already-clean surface.

The conversation was over.

---

But Chronicler wasn't ready to give up.

"One more question."

Kote paused, hand on the cloth.

"The true name—the one that opens the first lock. Do you know what it is?"

"Of course. It's my name."

"Then speak it. If I've truly understood everything you've told me, I'll understand it. And the first lock will open."

"You can't understand someone's true name from hearing them say it."

"Maybe not. But after three days of listening—maybe I know you well enough now." Chronicler leaned forward. "Try. What's the harm?"

Kote looked at him. At Bast. At the chest.

Something shifted in his expression. Not hope—but something adjacent to it.

"Alright. But don't expect miracles."

He closed his eyes.

And spoke his true name.
