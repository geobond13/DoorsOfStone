THE FIRE HAD died while Kote was speaking.

Neither Chronicler nor Bast had moved to tend it. The story held them frozen, waiting for what came next.

"And that's where I've been," Kote said quietly. "For years now. Running an inn. Keeping silence. Waiting for something I can't name."

"But you could open the chest," Chronicler said. "If you wanted to."

"Could I?" Kote looked at the chest in the corner—the roah wood, the copper bindings, the three locks that had never been touched. "The keys don't exist. The conditions for opening aren't met. And even if they were—"

"You're afraid."

"Yes." The word came out simple. True. "I'm afraid of what's inside. Afraid of what I might become if I released it."

"But the world needs—"

"The world doesn't know what it needs." Kote's voice was sharp. "I spent years thinking I knew. Thinking I could fix things. Save people. Be the hero the stories claimed." He shook his head. "I was wrong. Every time I tried to help, I made things worse."

"That's not true," Bast said. "You sealed the doors. Stopped Cinder. Saved—"

"Saved what? The woman I loved became a seal. The friends I had scattered or died. The abilities I'd spent my whole life developing—gone." Kote looked at his hands. "I'm not a hero, Bast. I'm a warning. A cautionary tale about what happens when you think you're clever enough to save the world."

Chronicler set down his pen.

"The story isn't finished," he said. "You're still here. Still alive. Still connected to Denna through the silence."

"What difference does that make?"

"It makes all the difference." Chronicler leaned forward. "You've spent years waiting. Hiding. Pretending to be someone you're not. But the story you're telling—it's not about an ending. It's about a pause."

"A pause."

"The hero retreats. Licks his wounds. Learns from his mistakes." Chronicler met Kote's eyes. "And then, when the time is right, when the world needs him again—"

"He comes back." Kote laughed bitterly. "Is that what you want? A triumphant return? Kvothe the Kingkiller, risen from the ashes to save the day?"

"I want the truth. Whatever that is."

"The truth is that I don't know what comes next. I've been waiting for something—some sign, some call, some reason to stop hiding—but it hasn't come. And I'm starting to think it never will."

"Maybe you have to create it yourself."

"Create what?"

"The reason to act." Chronicler stood. "The story you're telling—it's not just history. It's a mirror. A way of understanding who you are and what you're capable of." He gestured at the chest. "The things locked inside—they're not just power. They're potential. The potential to be Kvothe again."

"Or to become something worse."

"Or that." Chronicler nodded. "But isn't that always the risk? Every time you've acted, every time you've made a choice—there was a chance it would go wrong. That never stopped you before."

Bast was crying.

Not loudly—just silent tears running down his face. He'd heard this story before, pieces of it, fragments. But hearing it all together, understanding the full weight of what his Reshi had been through...

"Reshi," he said, his voice cracking. "Open the chest."

"What?"

"The conditions. You said the locks would release under specific circumstances." He wiped his eyes. "What are they?"

Kote was quiet for a long moment.

"The first lock opens when someone speaks my true name with full understanding. Not Kvothe—my true name. The one beneath all the others."

"And the second?"

"Opens when someone I love calls me back. Really calls me, with genuine need and genuine love."

"And the third?"

Kote hesitated.

"The third opens when I stop being afraid of what's inside. When I accept that the power might corrupt me, might destroy me—and choose to take it anyway."

"Three conditions," Chronicler said. "Three keys that aren't keys."

"Three doors that have stayed closed for years." Kote looked at the chest. "Because no one knows my true name. Because Denna can't call me—she's too diffuse, too scattered across the binding. And because I'm still afraid."

"But—"

"No." Kote's voice was firm. "The chest stays locked. The story ends here—with waiting. With silence. With an innkeeper who used to be someone else."

He walked behind the bar.

Picked up his cloth.

Began to wipe.

The conversation was over.

---

But Chronicler wasn't ready to give up.

"One more question," he said. "And then I'll stop."

Kote paused.

"What?"

"The true name. The one that opens the first lock." Chronicler's voice was careful. "Do you know what it is?"

"Of course I know. It's my name."

"Then speak it. Say it out loud, and I'll understand it—truly understand it—and the first lock will open."

"You can't understand someone's true name from hearing them say it. It doesn't work that way."

"Maybe not. But maybe, after three days of listening to your story—maybe I know you well enough now." Chronicler leaned forward. "Try. What's the harm?"

Kote looked at him.

At Bast, still crying silently.

At the chest, waiting in the corner.

And something shifted in his expression.

"Alright," he said. "I'll speak it. But don't expect miracles."

He closed his eyes.

Drew a breath.

And spoke his true name.
