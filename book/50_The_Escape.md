AURI KNEW PATHS I'd never imagined.

Not through the Underthing—these were something else. Doors between places. Thin spots in reality where, if you knew how, you could step from one location to another instantly.

"The binding wasn't just prison," she explained, as we walked through a forest that shouldn't exist. "It was education. Cinder's patterns taught me things about the world's structure. About how places connect."

"He bound you to teach you?"

"He bound me to use me. The teaching was incidental." She ducked under a branch that appeared to be made of crystallized moonlight. "But knowledge is knowledge. I kept what I learned even after the binding broke."

"Where are we going?"

"Somewhere safe. Somewhere they won't think to look for you."

"Who?"

"Everyone." She glanced back at me. "Meluan's hunters are searching the Four Corners. The University has issued statements distancing themselves from you. And there are others—followers of Cinder, people who believed in what he was trying to do—who want revenge."

"I'm a wanted man."

"You're a dead man, according to the rumors. Some say you died in the explosion at Renere. Some say you were consumed by the magic you tried to control." She smiled faintly. "Let's keep it that way. Dead men don't have to run."

We traveled for weeks through impossible places.

Forests where the trees grew upside down. Valleys filled with mist that whispered in languages I didn't recognize. Cities abandoned so long ago that even their ruins had crumbled to dust.

"These are the between-places," Auri explained. "The spaces that exist in the cracks of reality. The binding sealed most of them, but some remain—small pockets, forgotten corners."

"Is this where you'll hide me?"

"No. These places are too unstable. You need somewhere more permanent." She paused at a crossroads I couldn't see. "There's a village. Small. Remote. The kind of place where strangers are rare but not unwelcome."

"A village."

"A chance to be someone else. To build a life that isn't defined by what you were." She touched my arm. "The world thinks Kvothe is dead, or worse. Let them think it. Become someone new."

"Someone who can't play music. Can't name the wind. Can't do any of the things that made him who he was."

"Someone who's still alive. Someone who can learn new things." Her eyes were gentle. "The old Auri would have died in Cinder's binding. The new Auri survived it. Changed, yes. Diminished in some ways. But still here. Still herself."

"How do you do it? Accept the change?"

"I don't accept it. I just live it." She began walking again. "Acceptance comes later. Sometimes never. But living—that's just putting one foot in front of the other."

The village was called Newarre.

A small place—a handful of farms, a general store, an inn with a faded sign. The kind of village that existed in a hundred places throughout the Commonwealth. Unremarkable. Forgettable.

Perfect.

"The inn is empty," Auri said. "The previous owner died last year. No one's claimed it."

"You want me to run an inn?"

"I want you to have somewhere to be. Something to do." She looked at the weathered building. "The silence you carry makes you invisible, in a way. People's eyes slide past you. They don't remember your face."

"A useful trick for a fugitive."

"A useful trait for someone who needs to disappear." She handed me a key. "Stay here. Build a new life. And when you're ready—when you've figured out who you are now—you can decide what comes next."

"What if I'm never ready?"

"Then you stay forever. Run the inn. Serve drinks. Listen to the stories travelers tell." She smiled. "There are worse fates than becoming a keeper of stories."

She left the next morning.

I stood in the doorway of the inn that would become my home, watching her walk down the road toward the horizon. The paths she walked weren't visible to me—just the ordinary road, leading to ordinary places.

"Will I see you again?" I called.

"When you need me." Her voice drifted back. "I know where you are now. And I'm never as far away as I seem."

Then she was gone.

And I was alone.

In a village that didn't know my name. In a building that needed repairs. With a silence inside me that would never fully fade.

I walked into the inn.

Looked around at the dusty common room. The empty bar. The cold fireplace.

And I began to clean.

---

It took months to make the place habitable.

I fixed the roof. Replaced the windows. Rebuilt the bar with wood I cut myself. The work was good—physical, demanding, requiring no gifts I'd lost.

And slowly, the inn became something.

Not just a building. A place. A destination for travelers who needed rest. A space where stories could be told and drinks could be served and life could go on.

I called it the Waystone.

A name that meant nothing and everything. A reference to paths between places. A reminder of what I'd lost and what I'd found.

And as the seasons turned, as the months became years, I stopped being Kvothe.

Not all at once. Not completely. But piece by piece, the legend faded. The stories became distant. And what remained was simpler. Quieter.

A man called Kote.

Who ran an inn.

Who kept silence.

Who waited.

For what, I didn't know.

But I waited anyway.

Because waiting was what I had left.
