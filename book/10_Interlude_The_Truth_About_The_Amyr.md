CHRONICLER SET DOWN his pen.

Outside the Waystone Inn, clouds had gathered thick and dark, casting the common room in a grey half-light that made the fire seem brighter than it was. The rain hadn't started yet, but it was coming. You could feel it in the air, that heavy pressure that preceded a storm.

"You expect me to believe this."

The innkeeper looked up from the bar. His expression was unreadable.

"You expect me to believe," Chronicler continued, his voice edged with something that might have been frustration or disbelief, "that the Amyr—the legendary Amyr, sworn enemies of the Chandrian for three thousand years—were actually *protecting* them? That everything we know about history is wrong?"

"Everything *you* know. Everything *I* knew." The innkeeper's voice was flat. "That's the point, isn't it? We only know what we're allowed to know."

"But the stories—"

"Are stories. Written by the victors. Curated by men like Lorren, who decide which books survive and which ones burn." The innkeeper picked up a glass, began to polish it with slow, methodical motions. "I believed the same things you believe. For years. I built my entire life around hunting monsters, seeking revenge for what the Chandrian did to my family."

"And now you're telling me it was all a lie?"

"I'm telling you it was more complicated than the stories suggest." He set the glass down, reached for another. "The Chandrian are real. They did kill my parents. That part is true. But *why* they killed them—what they were trying to prevent—" He shook his head. "I didn't understand that until it was far too late."

Bast moved from his place by the window, coming to stand beside the bar. His face was pale in the grey light, his expression troubled.

"The Amyr are real too," Bast said quietly. "I've seen them. The Sithe hunt anyone who speaks to the Cthaeh, but the Amyr... they work in the shadows. Guiding. Protecting. Containing."

Chronicler looked between them. "Containing what?"

"What do you think happens when an ancient curse is broken?" The innkeeper's voice was very soft. "The Chandrian aren't free agents. They're *bound*. Chained to forms and rules and limitations. Kill the chain, and you don't just free the prisoner. You release whatever was keeping them weak."

"The Scrael."

"Just the beginning." The innkeeper set down the second glass. "The Scrael are heralds. Scouts. What follows them is much worse—things that don't have names anymore, that were locked away before language existed to describe them."

Chronicler was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was uncertain.

"How do you know any of this is true? Maybe Bredon was lying. Maybe the whole thing was a manipulation—"

"It was. All of it." The innkeeper smiled, but there was no humor in it. "Bredon manipulated me. Cinder manipulated me. Even Denna manipulated me, whether she meant to or not. Everyone was playing a game, and I was the only one who didn't know the rules."

"Then how do you know—"

"I know because I saw what happened when the binding cracked. I know because I watched the world start to break apart, and I understood—finally, too late—that everything I'd been fighting for was exactly what the enemy wanted." He looked at Chronicler, and his eyes were very old. "You can believe me or not. It doesn't change what happened. It doesn't change what I did."

The silence stretched between them, heavy as the gathering storm.

"What did you do?" Chronicler asked finally.

The innkeeper turned away, looking out the window at the darkening sky.

"I went to Renere," he said. "I walked into the trap Cinder had set for me, thinking I could spring it and walk away. I thought I was clever enough to outsmart a creature that had been playing games for three thousand years."

He laughed—that hollow, broken sound.

"I wasn't. And the price of my arrogance was everything I loved."

He turned back to them. His face was composed now, a mask sliding into place.

"But that's the next part of the story. The part where everything falls apart." He moved back behind the bar, picked up his cloth. "Shall we continue?"

Chronicler hesitated. Then he reached for his pen.

"Yes," he said. "Tell me what happened in Renere."
