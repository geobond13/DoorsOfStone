THEY CAME FOR me on the fourth day.

Not the King's guard—they were still in chaos, fighting over who had authority now that their monarch was dead. Not the Amyr—they had their own problems, scattered across the Four Corners, trying to contain the fallout from the binding's partial collapse.

No. The ones who came for me were something older. Something that had been waiting for this moment for three thousand years.

The Chandrian.

---

I was in a small village east of Renere, traveling under a false name, wearing clothes I'd stolen from a farmer's line. The shaed was hidden in my pack—too distinctive to wear openly. Caesura was strapped to my back, wrapped in cloth that made it look like a walking stick.

I'd been moving for three days. Barely sleeping. The void in my chest had settled into something manageable—not gone, but contained. Controlled. Like carrying a wound that would never quite heal.

The first sign was the iron. Every piece of metal in the village began to rust simultaneously. Nails turned brown. Tools crumbled. A blacksmith screamed as his anvil dissolved beneath his hammer.

The second sign was the silence. Not the silence I'd spoken—something different. A hush that fell over the village like a shroud, swallowing the sounds of life and leaving only dread.

The third sign was the man who stepped out of shadows that shouldn't exist.

Cinder.

He looked the same as I remembered from that night in the forest. The night my parents died. The white hair. The black eyes. The smile that promised suffering.

"Kvothe." His voice was like frost on glass. "The boy who killed my song. The boy who thought he could stop what was coming."

I reached for Caesura. Found my hand moving through air, the sword vanishing before I could touch it.

"No weapons." Cinder stepped closer. "No names. Just you and me and the debt you owe."

"I owe you nothing."

"You owe me everything." Another step. "I spent centuries crafting that binding. Centuries preparing the singer, writing the song, arranging every piece on the board. And you—a child, barely trained, drunk on power you don't understand—you ruined it in a single breath."

"Good."

He moved faster than sight. One moment he was ten feet away; the next his hand was around my throat, lifting me off the ground.

"Good?" His voice was soft now. Gentle. Terrifying. "Do you know what was supposed to happen? Do you understand what you prevented?"

"The doors opening. The binding shifting to you."

"The doors opening *correctly*. The binding shifting *completely*." His grip tightened. "Instead, you cracked everything. Half-measures and broken seals. The doors aren't closed anymore—they're leaking. And what's leaking through..."

He dropped me. I fell to my knees, gasping.

"Look around you, Kvothe. Look at the rust. The silence. The fear in everyone's eyes." He spread his arms wide. "This is what you accomplished. Not salvation—acceleration. The darkness was supposed to come under my control, in measured doses, manageable. Now it's coming wild. Uncontrolled. Hungry."

"You're lying."

"I'm many things, but I've never lied to you." He knelt, brought his face close to mine. "The binding is failing. The doors are cracking. And instead of a thousand years of careful transition, we have maybe a decade before everything falls apart."

"Then fix it. If you're so powerful—"

"I can't." The words seemed to cost him something. "The binding was designed by namers greater than me. Haliax might have been able to repair it, but Haliax is..."

He trailed off. Something flickered across his face—an emotion I couldn't read.

"What happened to Haliax?"

"Your silence happened." Cinder stood. "When you spoke the name, you didn't just break the song. You broke the center of the binding. Haliax was the anchor—the one who held everything together. And when the silence touched him..."

"He's dead?"

"He's *gone*. Dissolved. Unmade." Cinder's voice was hollow. "Three thousand years, holding back the darkness, and you erased him in a heartbeat. Do you know what that makes you, Kvothe? Not a hero. Not a savior."

"What?"

"The greatest disaster since the Creation War." He stepped back, and the shadows began to gather around him. "I'm going to let you live. For now. Not because I'm merciful—because I need you. The silence in you is the only thing that might be able to seal the cracks you've made."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then the world ends, and we all die together." He smiled—cold, bitter. "But don't worry. I'll make sure you watch everyone you love die first. Starting with the friends you left behind at the University."

He dissolved into shadows. The rust stopped spreading. The silence lifted.

And I was alone, in a ruined village, with the weight of the world pressing down on my shoulders.

---

I ran.

Not toward the University—Cinder would expect that. Not toward any of the places I was known, the friends who might shelter me. I ran to the edges of the map, to the places where even the Chandrian might not think to look.

To Newarre.

A nothing town in a nothing corner of the world. The kind of place where people minded their own business, where a stranger could become a local if he was quiet enough, ordinary enough, forgettable enough.

I arrived in spring. Bought an inn with money I'd saved from my time with the Maer. Changed my name. Changed my face. Changed everything about myself that might attract attention.

And I waited.

Waited for the cracks to spread. For the doors to finish opening. For Cinder to come back and demand the payment he'd promised.

Waited for years.

Years that turned the burning shame into cold regret. That ground the sharp edges of grief into smooth, familiar ache. That transformed Kvothe the Kingkiller into Kote the innkeeper, one day at a time, until even I started to believe the lie.

---

"That's when you built the chest," Chronicler said. "Sealed yourself away."

"The chest was later. After I'd been in Newarre for... a while." The innkeeper's voice was distant. "I needed time to prepare. Time to understand what I was becoming."

"What you were becoming?"

"The silence changes you. Every time you touch it, it takes something. Leaves something behind." He looked at his hands—ordinary hands, an innkeeper's hands. "By the time I arrived here, I could barely play the lute. Couldn't remember the name of the wind. Could feel myself... fading."

"So you built a prison."

"I built a container. Locked away the parts of me that were still dangerous—the shaed, the shard of the binding, the connection to the silence." He shook his head. "I thought if I stayed quiet, stayed small, the cracks might heal on their own. The darkness might recede."

"Did it?"

"No." He laughed, bitter. "Of course not. The world kept getting worse. The war started. The scrael appeared. The doors kept leaking. And I sat here, polishing glasses, pretending I couldn't feel the end approaching."

"Until Chronicler arrived."

"Until you arrived." He looked up. "And forced me to remember what I was running from. What I was supposed to be doing. What Cinder is still waiting for."

"What happens now?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"Now the story is told. The truth is recorded. And I have to decide if I'm going to keep hiding, or if I'm going to do what should have been done years ago."

"Which is?"

"Find Cinder. Finish the binding. Close the doors for good." He stood, set down his cloth. "Or die trying. Which is considerably more likely."

"You're going to do it. You're going to fight."

"I'm going to try." He moved toward the stairs. "The question is whether there's anything left of Kvothe to do the fighting. Or whether Kote is all that remains."

He climbed the stairs, leaving Chronicler alone in the common room.

And in the darkness outside, something stirred. Something that had been waiting. Something that had finally heard the name it was listening for.

The hunt was about to begin.
