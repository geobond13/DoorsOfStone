SIMMON TACKLED ME before I made it ten steps from the admissions hall.

I'd like to say I was ready for it—that my Adem training kicked in and I flowed around the impact like water around a stone. But the truth is I went down like a sack of barley, hitting the cobblestones hard enough to drive the breath from my lungs.

"You're back!" Sim was on top of me, all gangly limbs and wild yellow hair, his face split with a grin so wide it looked painful. "You utter bastard, you're actually back!"

"Can't—" I wheezed. "Can't breathe—"

"Good! You deserve it!" He rolled off me anyway, scrambling to his feet and offering a hand. "Eight months, Kvothe. Eight months with nothing but a single letter saying you weren't dead. Do you have any idea—"

"I was busy." I let him pull me up, brushing dust from my clothes. "Bandits. Mercenaries. Sword training. The usual."

"The usual." Wilem's voice came from behind me, dry as old parchment. I turned to find him leaning against a nearby wall, arms crossed, his Cealdish features arranged in an expression of studied disapproval. "For most people, the usual involves classes and meals and perhaps the occasional drink with friends. Not disappearing for three-quarters of a year."

"I missed you too, Wil."

His face softened—just a fraction. "We were worried. Fela cried."

"I doubt that."

"Three times." Sim grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the familiar path to the Mews. "Come on. She's going to want to see you. Everyone's going to want to see you."

I let myself be led, half-listening to Sim's chatter about everything I'd missed. The new chancellor. The fire in the Medica. The scandal with Hemme and the Tehlins. It washed over me like water, familiar and strange at the same time.

Eight months. I'd known time moved differently, but I hadn't realized how different. For me, it felt like weeks—a blur of courts and forests and the strange timeless twilight of Felurian's clearing. But for them, for the world, it had been most of a year.

"—and you won't believe what happened with Ambrose," Sim was saying. "He's gotten worse. Much worse."

"How is that possible?"

"His father. Lord Jakis made some kind of deal with the Maer—something about trade rights, I think. It's given Ambrose... ideas."

Wilem fell into step beside us, his voice low. "He's building something, Kvothe. Not like before, not just petty harassment. He's been making allies, calling in favors. There are rumors he's next in line for Re'lar."

I stopped walking. "Ambrose? Re'lar?"

"Brandeur's been teaching him naming." Sim's face had lost some of its brightness. "Privately. We're not supposed to know, but—"

"Ambrose can't name a boot in a bootshop."

"Maybe not. But he can buy tutors. And silence." Wilem's eyes met mine, and there was something in them I'd never seen before. Something that looked almost like fear. "Things have changed while you were gone. Not for the better."

Fela was in the Archives, which surprised no one. What surprised me was the way she looked when she saw me—first relief, then fury, then something more complicated that she hid behind a fierce embrace.

"You're an idiot," she whispered into my shoulder. "You know that, right? A complete and total idiot."

"I've been told." I hugged her back, carefully. Fela was tall—almost as tall as me—and stronger than she looked. "I'm sorry. I should have sent more letters."

"You should have come back sooner." She pulled away, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "Sim nearly did something stupid. Twice. Wilem had to talk him down."

I looked at Sim, who had the grace to look embarrassed. "Stupid how?"

"He was going to come looking for you," Fela said. "He'd heard about the bandits in the Eld, and he thought—" She shook her head. "It doesn't matter. You're back. That's what matters."

We found a quiet corner of the Archives—one of the reading rooms where Re'lars could speak in low voices without drawing Lorren's ire. I told them what I could about my time away: the Maer's court, the bandit hunt, the Adem and their strange ways. I left out the details that would have raised questions I couldn't answer. Felurian. The Cthaeh. The growing certainty that something was terribly wrong with the world.

"And Denna?" Fela asked, when the official story was finished. "Have you seen her?"

My chest tightened. "Not yet."

"She's been here. Off and on." Fela exchanged a glance with Sim, the kind of look that meant something I wasn't supposed to catch. "She's been asking about you."

"I'm sure she has."

"Kvothe." Fela leaned forward, her voice dropping. "There's something different about her. I don't know how to explain it. She's... sharper. More careful. And there's this song she's been working on—"

"A song?"

"About Lanre. About the Chandrian." Fela shook her head. "It's beautiful, but there's something about it that makes me... uncomfortable. I can't explain it."

I wanted to ask more, but Sim was already standing, already pulling me toward the door.

"Later," he said. "Right now, we're going to the Eolian. I need a drink, and you need to explain exactly how you learned to throw a knife at a man's eye from thirty paces."

"I never said—"

"The letter, Kvothe. You mentioned it in the letter. And now you're going to tell me everything."

---

We didn't make it to the Eolian.

I told them I needed to check my room first—to drop off my travel pack, to wash, to change into clothes that didn't smell like three days of road. They believed me, because it was true. But there was another reason, one I didn't mention.

Auri.

The moon was rising by the time I climbed onto the roof of Mains. The familiar path was just where I remembered it—across the tiles, up the drainpipe, along the ledge that overlooked the courtyard below. My feet knew the way, even after all these months.

She was waiting for me.

I don't know how she knew I was coming. I hadn't sent word—there was no way to send word to someone who lived in the spaces between things. But she was there, sitting on the edge of the roof with her feet dangling over the drop, her silver-white hair catching the moonlight like spun glass.

"You came back," she said. Her voice was soft, high, a little girl's voice in a woman's body. "I knew you would. The moon told me."

"The moon tells you a lot of things."

"Only the true ones." She turned to look at me, and her eyes—too large for her face, too bright for the darkness—held something that made my heart ache. "You've been to see her. The lady who doesn't let go."

Felurian. She meant Felurian.

"I have."

"Did she try to keep you?"

"Yes."

Auri nodded, as if this confirmed something she'd suspected. "But you're still you. That's good. Some people aren't, when they come back. They're just... echoes. Pretty shells with nothing inside."

I sat down beside her, careful not to get too close. Auri didn't like to be touched without warning. "How have you been?"

"Busy." She smiled—a secret smile, like a child hiding a present behind their back. "The Underthing has been restless. Doors opening that should stay closed. Whispers in the pipes. Something is waking up."

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the wind. "What do you mean?"

"I don't know." Her face clouded. "That's what I mean. I always know what things mean. That's my gift. But lately..." She trailed off, pulling her knees up to her chest. "Lately there are things I can't name. Things that don't have names yet. Things that are becoming."

We sat in silence for a moment, watching the moon rise over the University. Somewhere in the distance, a bell began to toll—soft, melancholy, marking an hour that belonged only to scholars and ghosts.

"I have something for you," Auri said finally.

She reached into the pocket of her ragged dress and produced a small object, cupped carefully in both hands. She held it out to me, and I saw—

A key.

But not like any key I'd ever seen. It was made of bone—white and polished, with teeth that seemed to shift and change in the moonlight. Too many teeth. Teeth that didn't match any lock I could imagine.

"What does it open?"

"The door that has no door," Auri said. Her voice was strange now, distant, as if she was speaking from very far away. "The way between. The place where names go when they're forgotten."

I didn't touch it. Something in me—some instinct deeper than thought—recoiled from that key. From what it represented.

"Auri. I don't understand."

"I know." She smiled again, but there was sadness in it now. Something old and heavy. "You will, though. When the time comes. When you need it most, you'll understand."

"I can't take this."

"You have to." She pressed it into my hands, and it was warm—far too warm for bone, far too warm for the cold night air. "It's yours. It was always yours. I've just been keeping it safe until you were ready."

The key settled into my palm like it belonged there. Like it had been made for my hand, shaped to my fingers. I wanted to throw it away. I wanted to keep it forever.

"Thank you," I said, because I didn't know what else to say.

Auri stood, brushing off her dress with precise, careful motions. "You should go. Your friends are waiting. And she'll be here soon."

"Who?"

But Auri was already gone, vanishing over the edge of the roof with the easy grace of a falling leaf. I heard her feet on the drainpipe, then nothing.

I looked at the key in my hand. In the moonlight, the bone seemed to glow with a pale inner light. The teeth shifted again, arranging themselves into a pattern that might have been a word, or might have been a warning.

I put it in my pocket.

I climbed down from the roof.

And three days later, Denna came back.

"Wait."

Chronicler's voice broke through the memory. The innkeeper blinked, and for a moment he looked almost surprised to find himself standing in the Waystone, behind the bar, a million miles from the rooftops of his youth.

"The key," Chronicler said. "What was it for?"

"I didn't know then." The innkeeper's hand moved unconsciously to his pocket—an old habit, clearly. "I didn't know for a long time."

"But you know now."

"Yes." He looked toward the window, toward the grey morning light. Toward the chest upstairs, the one with three locks. "It opens the doors that have no doors. The spaces between names. The places where things go when they're forgotten."

Bast made a small sound. "The chest—"

"Not the chest. Something else. Something worse." The innkeeper picked up his cloth again, began to wipe the bar. "Auri knew. Somehow, she always knew. She was preparing me for what was coming."

"What was coming?"

The innkeeper didn't answer. He just kept wiping, kept cleaning a bar that didn't need cleaning, while outside the wind began to rise and the grey sky grew greyer still.

"Denna," he said finally. "Denna was what was coming. And by the time I understood that, it was already too late."
