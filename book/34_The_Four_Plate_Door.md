LORREN FOUND ME at midnight.

I was in my room, studying the key Auri had given me—the old iron thing covered in symbols I couldn't quite decipher—when a knock came at my door. Quiet, precise, the kind of knock that expected to be answered.

Master Lorren stood in the hallway, his face as impassive as ever, but something in his eyes that I'd never seen before.

Fear.

"Come with me," he said. "Now."

---

We walked through the University in silence.

The paths were empty at this hour, the buildings dark, the only sound our footsteps on cobblestone and the distant hoot of an owl. Lorren led the way without looking back, his long strides eating the distance between my room and the Archives.

At the great doors, he stopped.

"What I'm about to show you should not exist," he said. "There are perhaps three people living who know it's real. I'm adding you to that number because I no longer have a choice."

"Why?"

"Because the seals are failing. Because what's behind them is stirring. And because you, for reasons I don't entirely understand, seem to be central to whatever happens next."

He produced a key from his robes—not a key to the Archives, which I'd seen before, but something older. Iron, like Auri's key, but larger. The symbols on its surface moved in the lamplight.

"When we enter," he continued, "do not speak. Do not touch anything without permission. Do not look away from what I show you, no matter how much you might want to." He met my eyes. "Can you promise me these things?"

"I promise."

He unlocked the door.

---

The Archives at night were different.

During the day, the great hall was filled with the soft sounds of study—turning pages, scratching quills, the occasional whispered conversation. Now it was silent in a way that felt deliberate, as if the building itself was holding its breath.

Lorren led me through stacks I recognized, then through stacks I didn't. The deeper we went, the older the shelves became—wood giving way to stone, brass fittings giving way to iron, modern binding giving way to leather and vellum and materials I couldn't identify.

Finally, we reached the Four Plate Door.

It stood as it always had—massive, imposing, the copper plate at its center dark with age. But tonight, something was different. The door was humming.

Not a sound you could hear with your ears. A vibration in your bones, in your blood, in the parts of your mind that remembered things from before you were born.

"It's been getting louder," Lorren said quietly. "For the past two months. Whatever's behind it is waking up."

"What is behind it?"

"The truth." He produced another key—smaller, simpler, but made of the same strange iron. "The truth about everything the University was built to protect."

He placed the key in a lock I'd never noticed before, hidden in a seam of the copper plate, and turned.

The door swung open.

---

Beyond the Four Plate Door was a staircase.

Wide stone steps, descending into darkness. The walls were carved with symbols—the same symbols from Auri's key, from Lorren's key, from the marks I'd seen on Denna's skin. They covered every surface, overlapping and intertwining, forming patterns that seemed to shift when you looked at them directly.

Lorren lit a lamp. The light revealed more stairs, descending far deeper than any natural basement should go.

"This way," he said.

We descended.

The temperature dropped as we went down—not the cold of underground spaces, but something else. Something that felt more like the absence of warmth than the presence of cold. The symbols on the walls grew denser, more complex, and the humming vibration grew stronger, pressing against my awareness like a physical weight.

After what felt like hours, we reached the bottom.

A chamber. Vast, circular, lit by sources I couldn't identify. And at its center, standing on a raised platform of black stone...

A door.

Not like the Four Plate Door. This was older. Stranger. The surface was smooth as glass, dark as the space between stars, covered in writing that moved and shifted like something alive.

"This is what the Archives were built to protect," Lorren said. His voice was hushed, reverent. "One of the original seals. One of the doors that was closed when the world was broken and remade."

"What's behind it?"

"We don't know exactly. The records are incomplete—destroyed, hidden, or never written." He moved toward the platform, steps careful on the ancient stone. "But we know it's dangerous. Dangerous enough that the people who sealed it sacrificed everything to keep it closed."

"The Shapers."

"And the Namers. And others whose names we've forgotten." He stopped at the edge of the platform. "This door has been sealed for three thousand years. Until recently, it was stable—dormant, as silent as stone. But now..."

He gestured, and I saw what he meant.

The writing on the door's surface wasn't just moving. It was changing. Flowing in patterns that hadn't been there before, forming shapes that looked almost like words, almost like names, almost like a song waiting to be sung.

"It's trying to open," I said.

"Something is trying to open it. From the other side." Lorren's voice was grim. "The seals we studied, the bindings we maintained—they're failing. Not just here. All over the Four Corners. Every door that was closed is beginning to crack."

"Why?"

"That's what I brought you here to see." He moved around the platform, toward a shelf carved into the chamber's wall. "The records. What's left of them. The true history of the Amyr, and the Chandrian, and the war that broke the world."

---

The records were written on materials I didn't recognize.

Not paper, not vellum, not stone. Something that felt almost organic, as if it had grown rather than been made. Lorren handled them carefully, spreading them on a reading surface that emerged from the platform when he touched a particular symbol.

"This is the oldest surviving account of the Creation War," he said. "Written by someone who was there. Someone who helped close the doors."

I looked at the writing. It was Yllish—ancient Yllish, the kind that predated written language, the kind that was spoken into being rather than inscribed.

"I can't read this."

"No. But you can feel it, can't you? The patterns. The meanings." He touched a symbol, and suddenly I could—not read, exactly, but understand. The words flowed into my mind like water into an empty vessel.

*We closed the doors because we had no choice.*

*What lived behind them was not evil. Was not good. Was simply... other. A way of being that could not coexist with our way of being. When they touched our world, reality unraveled. When they spoke our names, we ceased to exist.*

*The Shapers thought they could control them. Thought they could harness their power, direct their transformation, reshape the world according to their vision. They were wrong.*

*The war lasted a hundred years. When it ended, we had won. But the price...*

*The price was everything we had been.*

I pulled back, gasping. The understanding faded, leaving only impressions—images of fire and shadow, of doors slamming shut, of something vast and patient pressing against seals that would not last forever.

"The Chandrian," I said. "They were part of this?"

"The Chandrian were the price." Lorren's voice was heavy. "When the doors were sealed, someone had to guard them. Someone had to remain, bound to the seals, ensuring they stayed closed. Seven volunteers—seven heroes, depending on who tells the story—agreed to become the watchers."

"But the stories say the Chandrian are evil. That they want the doors to open."

"Stories change over three thousand years. Heroes become villains. Villains become heroes. The truth..." He shook his head. "The truth is that the binding was flawed. It kept the Chandrian tied to the seals, but it also... changed them. Made them something other than human. And some of them—"

"Some of them decided they wanted out."

"Yes." He touched another symbol, and another wave of understanding flowed through me.

*Haliax was the strongest. He held the binding together when others faltered. But the weight of it broke him. Three thousand years of endless watching, of feeling the things behind the doors pressing against his awareness, of knowing that release would never come...*

*He began to believe that opening the doors was the only mercy left. That oblivion was better than eternal imprisonment.*

*The others disagreed. Some of them. Not all.*

*The one called Cinder was the first to turn. Not toward Haliax's oblivion, but toward something worse. He believed that if the doors opened properly—if the energy was channeled correctly—he could become something more than human. Something more than Chandrian. Something that could survive the transformation of reality.*

*A god.*

*And he began to work toward that goal, carefully, patiently, over centuries.*

I pulled back again, my head spinning.

"Cinder is trying to become a god."

"Cinder is trying to harness the power that will be released when the doors open. To transform himself into something that can survive what's coming." Lorren's eyes were dark. "And he's very, very close to succeeding."

---

We spent hours in that chamber.

Lorren showed me more records—fragmented, incomplete, but together forming a picture that was terrifying in its scope. The Creation War. The sealing. The Amyr, formed in secret to maintain the bindings and prepare for the eventual failure. The Chandrian, bound and broken and slowly going mad.

And at the center of it all, a pattern that seemed to involve me.

"Your parents' song," Lorren said. "The one they were writing when they died. It wasn't just about Lanre. It was a map. A guide to the seals, the doors, the weaknesses in the binding."

"How do you know that?"

"Because we have a copy. One they sent to the Archives before they were killed." He produced another document—newer than the ancient records, but still old, its edges worn from handling. "They were close. Closer than anyone had gotten in centuries. And the Chandrian found out."

"Cinder killed them."

"Cinder killed them to stop them from sharing what they'd discovered. But he was too late. The song existed. The information survived. And now..." Lorren met my eyes. "Now you're carrying the same knowledge, in one form or another. You've been gathering it piece by piece, from Skarpi's stories to Bredon's secrets to whatever Denna has been forced to sing."

"Denna." The name hit me like a blow. "She's part of this too."

"She's the channel Cinder has been preparing. The instrument through which he'll direct the energy when the doors finally open." Lorren's voice was gentle. "I'm sorry. I know you care for her. But what's been done to her—"

"Can it be undone?"

He was silent for a long moment.

"I don't know. The records are incomplete. But there are references to... counter-measures. Ways of disrupting the channel, redirecting the energy." He touched the black door, and the symbols on its surface rippled. "The Amyr have been preparing for centuries. Not to close the doors—that's no longer possible. But to control what comes through. To shape the transformation rather than let it run wild."

"How?"

"By having someone ready to direct the energy somewhere else. Someone with enough knowledge of naming, enough connection to both sides of the boundary, enough..." He trailed off, looking at me.

"Enough what?"

"Enough personal stake in the outcome." His eyes were steady. "You've been building toward this your whole life, Kvothe. Every piece of knowledge you've gathered, every skill you've developed, every connection you've made—it's all preparation. For the moment when the doors open and someone has to choose what happens next."

"I didn't choose this."

"No. But choice isn't required. Only capability." He turned away from the door, began gathering the records. "You need to go to Renere. The largest of the seals is there, beneath the old palace. When it fails—and it will fail, within weeks—that's where the transformation will begin."

"And what do I do when I get there?"

"Whatever you have to." He handed me the documents—the records, the maps, the fragments of ancient knowledge that had been preserved for exactly this moment. "The Amyr will help you. Bredon has contacts in the city. But in the end..."

"In the end, I'm on my own."

"In the end, we all are." His voice was tired. Ancient. "Go. Prepare. And may whatever gods still care about this world watch over you."

---

I climbed the stairs alone.

Lorren stayed behind, tending to the door, maintaining the seals that were failing despite everything. By the time I reached the Archives' main hall, dawn was breaking through the windows, painting the shelves in shades of gold and rose.

The records sat heavy in my arms. The knowledge sat heavier in my mind.

The doors were opening.

Cinder was waiting.

And somewhere in Renere, Denna was singing a song that would either save the world or destroy it.

I had to get there first.

I had to find a way.

And I had to be willing to do whatever was necessary—even if it meant losing everything.

The stone, as Wil had said, was heavy.

I was done carrying it alone.

---

That afternoon, I gathered my friends.

Sim, Fela, Wil, Devi. I told them everything—the doors, the Chandrian, the transformation that was coming. They listened in silence, their faces growing pale as the scope of what I was describing became clear.

When I finished, no one spoke for a long moment.

Then Simmon cleared his throat.

"Well," he said. "I suppose this explains why you've been so broody lately."

And despite everything—despite the fear and the weight and the terrible knowledge pressing against my awareness—I laughed.

"Yes. I suppose it does."

"So what do we do?" Fela asked. "How do we help?"

"Renere," I said. "We go to Renere. We find Denna before the ritual begins. We stop Cinder if we can, contain the damage if we can't." I looked at each of them in turn. "This is dangerous. More dangerous than anything we've faced. You don't have to—"

"Don't be stupid," Wil interrupted. "Of course we're coming."

"We've been in danger since we met you," Sim added. "At least this time we know what we're walking into."

"Besides," Fela said, "someone has to keep you from doing something reckless."

"Or help you do something reckless properly," Devi added. "Recklessness without planning is just foolishness."

I looked at my friends. At the people who had chosen to stand beside me despite everything.

"Thank you," I said.

"Don't thank us yet." Wil's voice was dry. "Thank us when we survive."

"When," I said. "Not if."

"When," he agreed.

And we began to plan.
