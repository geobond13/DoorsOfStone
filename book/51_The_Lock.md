BAST FOUND ME in the third year.

He appeared one morning without warning—a young man with sharp features and sharper eyes, claiming to be looking for work. I knew what he was immediately. The Fae can disguise many things, but not the otherness that clings to them.

"You're not human," I said.

"No." He smiled. "And you're not just an innkeeper."

"Anymore, I am."

"Reshi." He used the title before I knew he would. "I know who you are. What you did. I've been looking for you for years."

"Why?"

"Because you're the only person who might understand what I'm carrying." He sat on a barstool. "And because the Fae realm is dying. Slowly, but surely. Ever since the doors were sealed—"

"The seal is necessary."

"I know. But that doesn't make it less painful." His eyes were ancient despite his young face. "I came to learn. To serve. To understand what's happening to my world."

I should have sent him away. Should have protected myself, protected him, protected the fragile anonymity I'd built.

Instead, I said: "The rooms upstairs need cleaning."

And Bast became part of my life.

He asked about the silence first.

"I can feel it in you," he said, one evening after the inn had closed. "A weight. A presence. It's connected to the binding, isn't it? To the seal that's strangling my world."

"I'm part of the seal now. Not all of it—just a piece. A lock that helps keep the doors closed."

"Does it hurt?"

"Not anymore. It's just... there. Like a scar that never quite heals."

"And the woman? The one the stories mention?"

"She's everywhere. Part of the binding itself. We're connected still, but reaching her is like trying to hold smoke."

Bast was quiet for a long moment.

"The Fae tell stories about you," he said finally. "About the man who broke Cinder. Who sealed the doors. Who gave up everything to save a world that doesn't even know what he did."

"Stories lie."

"Stories are all we have." He looked at me with something like reverence. "Let me stay. Let me learn. Whatever you can still teach me, whatever wisdom the silence hasn't consumed—"

"I don't have wisdom. I have routine."

"Then teach me routine." He smiled. "I'm very good at learning."

The chest came later.

I built it over months, working in the hours when Bast was asleep. Roah wood, the same material as the Lackless box. Iron and copper fittings. Three locks, each requiring a different key.

Bast asked about it once.

"What's inside?"

"Things I can't use anymore."

"Your lute?"

"Among other things." I ran my hand over the wood. "The abilities I lost when I unmade Cinder—some of them left residue. Echoes of power that I can't control but can't destroy either."

"So you locked them away."

"I gave them somewhere to be. Somewhere they can't hurt anyone." I looked at him. "The chest is sealed with the name of silence. No one can open it. Not even me."

"Then why build it?"

"Because containing something is better than pretending it doesn't exist." I closed my eyes. "The power I used to have—the music, the naming, the magic—it's not gone. It's just... locked. Waiting."

"For what?"

"I don't know. Maybe nothing. Maybe someday, when the world needs it again—"

"You'll open the chest."

"Or someone will." I looked at the three locks. "I designed it so that it could be opened. Three keys, three conditions, three moments when the locks might release. But the conditions are specific. Unlikely."

"What are they?"

I didn't answer.

Some things were too dangerous to share, even with friends.

Years passed.

The inn became my life. Wake. Clean. Cook. Serve. Listen to stories. Tell none of my own. Sleep, or something like it. Wake again.

Routine, as I'd told Bast.

The world moved on around me. Wars started and ended. Kings rose and fell. The University continued its work, training new Arcanists who knew nothing of the sacrifices that had been made.

And the silence inside me remained.

Not growing. Not shrinking. Just present. A constant reminder of what I'd been and what I'd become.

Denna reached for me sometimes.

Not often—the binding spread her too thin for frequent contact. But occasionally, in the quiet hours before dawn, I would feel her presence. Her voice, barely audible, saying things that didn't quite form words.

*Still here,* she would whisper. *Still holding.*

*I know,* I would answer. *I'm holding too.*

And we would be silent together, connected across the vast distance between what is and what was.

Two pieces of the same broken thing.

Still fitting, somehow.

Still holding on.
