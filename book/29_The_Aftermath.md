THE BALLROOM WAS silent.

Not the natural silence of a shocked crowd. This was the silence I'd spoken—still lingering, still heavy, still hungry for more. It pressed against my ears like deep water, swallowed every sound before it could form.

Around me, chaos. Nobles running, guards drawing weapons, servants screaming without making a sound. The King's body lay crumpled on the marble floor, his crown rolled into a corner, his blood spreading in a pool that seemed too large for one man to contain.

And Denna.

Denna lay where she'd fallen, her green dress spread around her like spring grass, her eyes open and staring at nothing. The braids in her hair were unraveling—the Yllish knots dissolving now that the song was broken, now that the singer was gone.

I tried to move toward her. Tried to speak her name. But the silence was still inside me, still connected to everything it had touched, and I couldn't find my voice.

Someone grabbed my arm. Spun me around. I saw faces—Stapes, pale and terrified; guards with swords drawn; nobles I didn't recognize pointing and shouting things I couldn't hear.

The silence was fading now. Sound returning in waves—first the deep throb of my heartbeat, then the shuffle of feet on marble, then screams and accusations and the clash of steel.

"MURDERER!"

The word cut through the chaos. Someone had found their voice. Someone was pointing at me, their face twisted with rage.

"He killed the King! The red-haired man—he spoke and the King died!"

More voices now. A chorus of accusation. The crowd turned toward me, their fear curdling into fury.

I should have run. Should have defended myself. Should have done something other than stand there, staring at Denna's body, feeling the weight of what I'd done crushing my chest.

"She moved!"

A different voice. Frightened. Awed.

"The girl—the singer—she's moving!"

I turned. And my heart, which I thought had already broken, shattered into a thousand pieces more.

Denna was moving. But not the way a living person moved.

The bindings in her hair—the ones I thought I'd broken—were reforming. Weaving themselves back together. And as they did, her body twitched, jerked, rose.

Not alive. Something worse.

She stood like a puppet on tangled strings, her head lolling, her eyes still vacant. And when she opened her mouth, the song came out.

Broken. Fragmented. Wrong.

But still powerful. Still binding. Still reaching for the crack in the world I'd failed to close completely.

---

"Kvothe!" Bredon's voice, cutting through the madness. "The binding—it's still active! She's—"

"I know." My voice came out as a croak. "I can see."

"You have to stop it. Completely this time. You have to—"

"SILENCE HER?" The word tore from my throat like a curse. "SHE'S ALREADY GONE, BREDON! I ALREADY KILLED HER!"

"You killed her body. But the song is still alive. It's using her—"

I didn't let him finish.

I reached for the silence again. Not gently this time. Not precisely. I grabbed it with both hands, pulled it from wherever it lived, and threw it at the thing that was wearing Denna's face.

The world went dark.

Not metaphorically dark. Actually, completely, totally dark. The silence I'd spoken was so vast, so deep, that it swallowed the light along with the sound. For three heartbeats—an eternity—there was nothing. No sight. No sound. No sensation at all.

Then I was on my knees, gasping, and the world was returning in fragments.

The song was gone.

The thing that had been Denna was gone.

In her place, just a dress. Just flowers. Just braids of hair dissolving into dust.

---

I don't remember leaving the ballroom.

I don't remember the escape through the palace, the hidden passages Bredon led me through, the safe house where we finally stopped running. I don't remember anything but the void where my heart used to be, and the knowledge that I'd killed her twice.

First with silence. Then with silence again.

"You had no choice." Bredon's voice, somewhere in the darkness. "The binding was still active. If you hadn't—"

"Don't."

"Kvothe—"

"I said don't." I was shaking. The whole room was shaking. Or maybe it was just me. "Don't tell me it was necessary. Don't tell me I did the right thing. Don't tell me anything."

Silence. The ordinary kind. The kind I hadn't spoken into being.

"The King is dead," Bredon said eventually. "The binding is broken. Cinder's plan has failed."

"Has it?"

"The doors aren't opening. The Chandrian are still contained. Whatever Cinder was trying to accomplish—"

"Denna is dead." I looked up at him, and I knew my eyes were wrong. Could feel the darkness in them, the void I'd touched too many times. "The King is dead. The world thinks I'm a murderer. And Cinder..."

I trailed off.

"Cinder is still out there," Bredon finished. "Yes. The song failed, but the singer who conceived it lives on."

"Then it's not over."

"No. It won't be over until Cinder is destroyed. Until the threat is truly eliminated." He sat down across from me, and I could see the exhaustion in him—centuries of it, weighted with fresh tragedy. "But that's a battle for another day. Right now, you need to rest. To process what happened. To—"

"Process?" The word came out broken, sharp. "How do you process killing the person you love? How do you process becoming exactly the monster the world thinks you are?"

"You don't. Not quickly." He met my eyes, and there was something ancient in his gaze. Something that had seen this before, in other eyes, in other centuries. "You carry it. You let it become part of you. And eventually, if you're very lucky, you find a way to keep living despite the weight."

"And if I'm not lucky?"

"Then you become what the silence tried to make you." His voice was very soft. "A void wearing a human face. An absence pretending to be a person."

I thought of the darkness in my eyes. The cold that had settled into my bones.

"Maybe I already am."

"Maybe." He didn't argue. Didn't try to comfort me. "But you're still here. Still talking. Still capable of feeling pain." He stood, moved toward the door. "That's not nothing, Kvothe. That's proof that something of you remains."

"Something."

"Something is better than nothing." He paused at the door. "Rest. Tomorrow, we plan. The day after, we move. The world is about to become very dangerous for you—more dangerous than it's ever been. You'll need your strength."

He left.

I sat alone in the darkness, surrounded by the silence I'd made, trying to remember what it had felt like to hope.

"Three days," Chronicler said. "You stayed in hiding for three days."

"Three days of planning. Three days of watching the world react to what I'd done." The innkeeper's voice was distant. "The King was dead. His heir was a child. The nobles were already fighting over the succession, and everyone was looking for someone to blame."

"You."

"The Kingkiller. The red-haired demon who spoke a word and killed a monarch." He laughed, hollow. "The stories started almost immediately. Each one worse than the last. By the end of the first day, I'd apparently killed the King with fire and lightning. By the end of the second, I'd summoned demons to devour his soul."

"And the truth?"

"The truth was worse. The truth was that I'd killed a man—several men—with a single word. That I'd destroyed the woman I loved because I couldn't control what I was doing. That I'd broken something inside myself that could never be repaired."

He set down his cloth.

"The stories people tell about me—the Kingkiller, the demon, the destroyer—they're wrong in the details but right in the spirit. I did terrible things that night. Things that can't be forgiven or explained away."

"But you stopped the binding. Saved the world from whatever was behind the doors."

"Did I?" He looked up, and his expression was haunted. "I stopped one attempt. Broke one binding. Killed one girl and one king. But Cinder is still out there. The doors are still cracked. And I'm sitting here, polishing glasses, pretending I'm just an innkeeper."

"You're not pretending."

"Am I not?" He picked up his cloth again. "Sometimes I'm not sure. Sometimes I think Kote is the truth and Kvothe is the lie. A story I told myself to explain how I ended up here, alone, waiting for something I can't name."

"And sometimes?"

"Sometimes I feel the silence stirring. The void where my music used to live. And I remember that I'm not waiting for something." His voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm hiding from it."
