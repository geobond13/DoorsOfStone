AMBROSE FOUND ME in the Fishery.

I was working on a commission for Kilvin—a heat-sink schema I'd been puzzling over since before I left—when his shadow fell across my workbench. I didn't look up. Didn't need to. The expensive cologne and the particular weight of his arrogance announced him better than any herald.

"So the prodigal returns." His voice dripped false pleasantry. "I'd heard rumors, of course. But I wanted to see for myself."

I continued adjusting the binding, keeping my hands steady. The Adem training helped. Anger was an emotion I could set aside when necessary.

"What do you want, Ambrose?"

"Just to welcome you back." He moved around the workbench, positioning himself in my line of sight. His smile was the smile of a cat who has cornered something interesting. "It's been a quiet eight months without you. Almost peaceful."

"I'm sure you found ways to amuse yourself."

"I did." His eyes glittered. "I made some new friends. Learned some interesting things. Discovered that the world is much larger than the petty conflicts we've waged here."

"How philosophical of you."

"How *practical* of me." He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Things are changing, Kvothe. Powers are shifting. And when the music stops, people are going to have to choose which side they're on."

I finally looked up, meeting his eyes. What I saw there surprised me. This wasn't the Ambrose I remembered—the spoiled noble brat with more money than sense. This was something else. Something harder. Something that had been shaped by forces I couldn't see.

"Is that a threat?"

"It's an observation." He straightened, adjusting his sleeves. "You've been away for a long time. You don't know how things stand anymore. The alliances, the debts, the arrangements." His smile widened. "You're exposed, Kvothe. More than you realize. And some of us have been waiting for exactly this moment."

He turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing through the Fishery.

I watched him go, my mind racing.

Ambrose had always been dangerous in the way that children with power are dangerous—carelessly cruel, thoughtlessly destructive. But this felt different. This felt like purpose. Like someone was pulling strings I couldn't see.

I went to the Archives that afternoon.

Not to research—not yet—but to observe. To see if the watchers Auri had mentioned would reveal themselves.

The main hall was as I remembered it: vast and echoing, filled with the smell of old paper and older secrets. Students moved between the stacks like ghosts, their footsteps muffled by centuries of accumulated dust. The scriv stations hummed with quiet activity.

And there, in the shadows near the restricted sections, I saw Lorren watching me.

He didn't try to hide it. When our eyes met, he simply nodded—a small acknowledgment that we both knew what was happening. Then he turned and walked deeper into the Archives, disappearing among the towering shelves.

An invitation. Or a challenge.

I followed.

The path led through sections I knew well and some I'd never explored. Past languages ancient and obscure. Past histories that had been old when the University was young. Past doors that had no handles and shelves that held no books—only spaces where books had once been.

*The pruned Archives*, I thought. *The knowledge that someone decided shouldn't exist.*

Lorren was waiting in a small study chamber, far from the main halls. The room held a single table, two chairs, and walls lined with empty shelves.

"Close the door," he said.

I did.

"You've returned from somewhere dangerous." It wasn't a question. "You've learned things that are dangerous to know. And you're going to keep asking questions that are dangerous to ask."

"Is that a problem?"

"It's reality." He gestured to the empty chair. "Sit."

I sat.

"I'm going to tell you something I've never told a student before," Lorren said. "Something that puts both our lives at risk. I'm doing this because you're going to keep digging regardless, and I'd rather you dig in the right direction than stumble into something that kills you."

"I appreciate that."

"Don't appreciate it. Just listen." He leaned forward, his stone face showing the first emotion I'd ever seen on it. Something like... resignation. "The Archives aren't just a repository. They're a weapon. A locked weapon, held by people who understand what certain kinds of knowledge can do."

"The Amyr."

He went very still. "Where did you hear that name?"

"Does it matter?"

"It matters very much." His voice was cold. "That name is not spoken lightly. Those who speak it tend to attract attention they don't survive."

"And yet you're not denying they exist."

"I'm not confirming it either." He stood, walked to the empty shelves, ran his fingers across them. "What I'm telling you is this: there are people who have spent centuries protecting the world from its own curiosity. People who make hard choices about what knowledge survives and what knowledge dies. People who understand that some doors should never be opened."

"Even if opening them might save someone I love?"

Lorren turned back to face me. "Especially then. The doors you're searching for—the ones connected to your parents' death, to the Chandrian, to everything you've been chasing since you were a child—they're closed for reasons. Good reasons. Reasons that existed before you were born and will exist long after you're gone."

"What reasons?"

"The same reasons that made your parents' death necessary." His voice was flat. Merciless. "They knew too much. They were getting too close. And the people who guard those doors decided the world was safer with them dead."

The words hit like a blade. For a moment, I couldn't breathe.

"You're saying the Amyr killed my parents."

"I'm saying nothing." Lorren walked to the door, paused with his hand on the handle. "I'm simply telling you that some secrets are kept secret because the alternative is worse than you can imagine. And the people who protect those secrets don't distinguish between enemies and curious students who push too hard."

"Is that a threat?"

"It's a warning." He opened the door. "Be careful what you seek, Kvothe. The answers you find might not be the ones you survive."

He left.

I sat alone in the empty room, surrounded by shelves that had once held knowledge—knowledge that someone had decided was too dangerous to exist.

*The Amyr killed my parents.*

*Or the Chandrian did.*

*Or both. Or neither. Or some combination of forces I couldn't begin to untangle.*

The Cthaeh had told me Cinder killed my parents. Lorren was implying something else entirely. And somewhere in the middle of all these contradictions, there was a truth that everyone seemed terrified of me discovering.

I was going to find it.

Whatever it cost.

Whoever I had to destroy to get there.

I stood, walked to the door, and went to find Devi.

She knew things about the Archives that even Lorren might not know. And unlike everyone else, she had no loyalty to the secrets being kept.

It was time to start asking the questions that nobody wanted answered.
