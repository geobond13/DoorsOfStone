THE DOOR WASN'T opening the way doors usually do.

There was no creak of hinges, no groan of ancient wood. Instead, reality itself was splitting—a crack forming in the air above the glowing floor, darkness bleeding through from somewhere else. Somewhere older. Somewhere that had been locked away since before the world had a name.

And Denna's song was the key.

I watched her voice rise, watched the patterns in her hair glow brighter with each note, watched the Yllish knots carved into her skin begin to pulse with light visible through the white silk of her dress. She was beautiful and terrible, a weapon forged from music and pain, and she was opening a door that had taken the combined might of namers and shapers and heroes to close.

I couldn't let it happen.

---

The guards beside me had relaxed slightly as the ritual began. Their attention was on Denna, on the crack in reality, on the dark shapes beginning to move in that impossible darkness. They had forgotten about me.

That was a mistake.

I called the wind.

Not loudly—not the great gusts I had summoned against bandits and thugs. Just a whisper. A breath. Enough to shift the air beside their ears, to make them turn their heads for just a moment.

And in that moment, I moved.

The first guard went down with my elbow in his throat. The second reached for his sword, but Simmon was there—brave, reliable Simmon—driving his shoulder into the man's midsection and sending them both sprawling across the glowing tiles.

"Go!" Sim shouted. "I've got them!"

I didn't need to be told twice.

I ran toward Denna.

---

The ballroom had descended into chaos.

Nobles were screaming, pushing toward exits that wouldn't open. The crack in reality was widening, and through it, things were beginning to emerge—shapes that hurt to look at, forms that made the mind recoil. They weren't fully in our world yet, just impressions, shadows, the first hints of what waited behind the doors.

But they were enough to drive men mad.

I saw a lord in a coat of burgundy velvet drop to his knees, hands over his ears, screaming prayers to gods who had no power here. I saw a lady in diamonds collapse against her companion, her face slack, her eyes empty. I saw a guard drop his sword and simply stand there, staring at nothing, all the life gone out of him.

The song was doing this. The song and the door and the ancient power flooding through the cracks.

And at the center of it all stood Cinder.

He wasn't hiding anymore. His eyes had returned to their true color—that impossible black, darker than darkness, the color of the void between stars. His face was transformed by something that might have been ecstasy, might have been hunger, might have been the terrible joy of someone watching three thousand years of planning finally come to fruition.

"Beautiful," he breathed. "Absolutely beautiful."

I was going to kill him.

But first, I had to stop the song.

---

Denna saw me coming.

Her voice never faltered—the spell was too deep in her now, the Yllish magic forcing her to continue whether she wanted to or not. But her eyes found mine, and in them I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.

Not fear. Not desperation.

Warning.

*Stop,* those eyes said. *Don't come closer. You'll die.*

I didn't listen.

I never listened.

I reached—

And Denna's hand came up, and the song shifted, and the air between us solidified into something harder than stone.

I slammed into it full force. Felt ribs crack. Tasted blood. Fell backward, gasping, onto the glowing tiles.

"Kvothe." Her voice was part of the song now, woven through it, words emerging in the spaces between notes. "You can't. It's too late. The song is in me. I AM the song. If you stop me—"

"I don't care!" I pushed myself up, ignoring the pain in my chest. "Denna, please—"

"You don't understand." Tears were streaming down her face, but her voice never wavered. "Look at me. Really look."

So I did.

---

The Yllish knots weren't just in her hair anymore.

They covered her skin—her arms, her neck, her face. Patterns of raised flesh and shadow, like brands that had healed wrong, like words written in scar tissue. In the glow from the floor, they pulsed with their own light, and I could see them moving, shifting, the letters and symbols rearranging themselves as the song progressed.

"He's been writing on me for months," Denna said, the words somehow separate from the melody that continued to pour from her lips. "Every lesson. Every meeting. Every time I thought he was punishing me, he was actually making me into this."

"Denna—"

"The song doesn't just come from my voice anymore. It comes from my body. From my blood. From the patterns in my flesh." Her eyes were desperate. "If you stop the song, Kvothe—if you silence me—the magic has to go somewhere. It will tear me apart."

I stared at her. At the glowing words carved into her skin. At the tears running down her cheeks.

"There has to be another way."

"There isn't. I've looked. I've tried." The song swelled around us, reaching toward its climax. "This is what I am now. This is what he made me. The only choice I have left is what I do with it."

"What do you mean?"

But before she could answer, Cinder appeared beside her.

---

"Touching." His voice was ice. "Truly touching. The lover's farewell, the noble sacrifice, the tragedy of doomed romance." He smiled—a expression that didn't belong on a human face. "But we're running behind schedule, my dear. The door is opening, but slowly. I need more from you."

"I'm giving you everything," Denna said. Her voice shook, but the song continued.

"Not quite everything." Cinder's hand rose, and I saw something glinting in his palm—a needle, thin as a hair, dark as his eyes. "The final verse requires blood. Your blood, spilled willingly, to complete the binding."

"I never agreed to that."

"You agreed to everything when you accepted my patronage." He stepped closer to her. "When you let me write the first word on your skin. When you sang the first note of my song." His smile widened. "You're mine, Denna. You've been mine since the moment we met. The only thing left is the ending."

I pushed myself to my feet.

"Get away from her."

Cinder turned. Looked at me. And laughed.

"Or what? You'll call the wind? Summon fire? Name me into submission?" He shook his head. "I've been named before, boy. Named and bound and sealed away for three thousand years. Do you really think you have the power to do what Lanre himself could not?"

"I have something Lanre didn't."

"And what's that?"

I looked at Denna. At the woman I loved. At the sacrifice Cinder was trying to make her.

"I have nothing left to lose."

---

I attacked.

Not with naming—Cinder was right that I couldn't match him there. Not with sympathy—I had no link, no source, nothing to bind us together. Not with any of the clever tricks I'd learned at the University.

I attacked with my bare hands.

It wasn't elegant. It wasn't skillful. It was the desperate violence of a man who had watched everything he loved twisted and broken, who had nothing left but rage and the willingness to die.

Cinder caught my first blow. Twisted. Threw me aside like I weighed nothing.

"Pathetic."

I got up. Attacked again.

He blocked. Countered. His fist caught me in the jaw, sent me spinning.

"Is this the best you have? This is what the great Kvothe has been reduced to?"

Blood filled my mouth. I spat. Attacked again.

This time, he didn't bother blocking. He simply stepped aside, let me stumble past, caught me by the back of the neck.

"I killed your parents," he said, his voice soft in my ear. "I burned your troupe. I raped your mother while your father watched. And you know what? I enjoyed it."

Something broke inside me.

Not my body—though that was breaking too. Something deeper. Something that had been holding on to hope, to restraint, to the belief that there was a right way to do this.

I stopped thinking about consequences.

I stopped thinking about plans.

I reached for the silence inside me—the deep, cold quiet that had lived in my heart since the night I watched my family burn—and I let myself become it.

---

The world went still.

Not quiet—the nobles were still screaming, the crack in reality was still widening, Denna's song was still rising toward its climax. But around me, in me, there was a silence so profound that it seemed to swallow everything else.

I had touched this silence before. In the Fae, when Felurian taught me the basics of naming. In moments of desperation, when my mind reached for something beyond words. But I had never held it like this. Never shaped it. Never become the space where sound should be.

Until now.

"What—" Cinder's grip on my neck loosened. "What are you doing?"

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer. The silence had taken my voice, given me something else in return.

I turned to face him.

And for the first time since I'd known him, I saw fear in those black eyes.

---

"Stop this." His voice was distant, muffled by the silence that surrounded me. "You don't know what you're doing. The silence—you cannot shape it and remain yourself. It will unmake you."

Maybe he was right.

Maybe this power was beyond me, would burn through me like fire through paper, would leave nothing but ash and memory.

But Denna was still singing.

The door was still opening.

And Cinder was still standing between me and everyone I wanted to save.

"Let her go," I said. The words emerged from silence, shaped by absence, heavy with meaning that went beyond language.

"I can't. The ritual has begun. If I stop it now—"

"Let. Her. Go."

The silence pressed outward. I felt it touch Cinder, felt him flinch. Felt something in him—something ancient and terrible—recoil from the absence I was becoming.

"You're going to kill yourself," he said. "And for what? A woman who was always going to die? A world that was always going to burn?" He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You can't save anyone, Kvothe. That's the truth you've been running from your whole life. Everyone you love dies. Everyone you touch turns to ash. That's what you are. That's what you've always been."

"Maybe."

I walked toward him. The silence walked with me.

"But at least I'll take you with me."

---

The fight wasn't a fight anymore.

It was a collision of forces—Cinder's ancient power against my newborn silence, three thousand years of experience against raw, desperate will. He threw naming at me, words of power that should have torn me apart, but the silence swallowed them. He tried sympathy, tried shaping, tried tricks and bindings older than the Empire, and I walked through them all.

Not because I was stronger.

Because I had already stopped caring if I survived.

"This is impossible," he snarled, backing away. "You're just a boy. A mortal. A nothing."

"You're right."

I caught him by the throat. The silence flowed through my fingers, into him, and I felt something—his essence, his power, the thing that had kept him alive for millennia—begin to crack.

"I'm nothing. I'm silence. I'm going to end you."

---

But I had forgotten about the King.

Roderic Calanthis had been watching from the edge of the confrontation, protected by his guards, observing as his plans fell apart. But now he stepped forward, his chain of office catching the light from the glowing floor, his face set in an expression of determination.

"Enough." His voice cut through the chaos—the voice of a man who had ruled for decades, who was used to being obeyed. "I am the King of Vintas. This is my palace. And I will not have my kingdom destroyed by—"

He stepped between us.

Between me and Cinder.

Between the silence and its target.

"Stand down," the King commanded. "Both of you. We can negotiate—"

But the silence didn't care about negotiations.

The silence didn't care about kings.

The silence only knew how to spread.

---

"Your Majesty, move!" Cinder shouted.

But it was too late.

The silence I had become, the absence I had shaped into presence, the unword I had given form and purpose—it was already reaching. Already touching. Already beginning to do what silence does.

I tried to pull it back. Tried to contain it. But it was like trying to hold water in my fists—the harder I squeezed, the faster it slipped away.

"Denna!" I screamed. "Stop singing! You have to—"

But she couldn't stop. The song was in her blood now, in her bones, in the very fiber of her being. She was the song, just as she'd said, and the song was reaching its final verse.

The crack in reality widened.

The darkness beyond began to pour through.

And Cinder smiled.

"Too late," he said. "Whatever you do now—whoever you kill—the door is already opening. You can't stop it."

He pushed past me—past the King, who was still standing there, confused and angry and utterly unprepared for what was happening—and walked toward the crack in reality.

"Thank you, Kvothe. For your silence. For your rage. For your beautiful, predictable attempt at heroism." He paused at the edge of the darkness. "You've given me exactly what I needed."

And he stepped through.

Into the dark.

Into whatever waited behind the Doors of Stone.

---

I stood in the center of a ruined ballroom.

The nobles were fleeing now, the doors finally open, guards abandoning their posts to join the stampede. The crack in reality was still there, but it wasn't growing anymore—whatever Cinder had done on the other side, whatever his purpose had been, the immediate crisis seemed to be passing.

But Denna was still singing.

And the silence was still spreading.

And the King was still standing between me and everyone I was trying to save.

"Your Majesty," I said. "Please. Move aside."

Roderic didn't move. His eyes were fixed on me—on the silence that clung to me like a second skin, on the power that I barely understood and couldn't fully control.

"What are you?" he asked.

"I don't know. But I'm trying to help."

"Help?" He laughed. "You've destroyed my ballroom. Released something into my kingdom. Driven my adviser into another world entirely." He shook his head. "You're not a helper. You're a disaster wearing a man's face."

He wasn't wrong.

But I didn't have time to explain.

Denna's song was reaching its final notes.

And if I didn't stop her—if I didn't find a way to break the magic without killing her—

The door would never close.

---

I stepped around the King.

Walked toward Denna.

The silence moved with me, eager and hungry, wanting to spread, to grow, to swallow everything in its path. I held it as tight as I could, trying to shape it, trying to make it do what I needed.

"Denna." I stopped a few feet from her. "I know you can hear me. I know the song is inside you. But you have to fight it. You have to find a way to stop."

Her eyes found mine. Desperate. Pleading.

*I can't,* they said. *It's too strong.*

"You can. You're the strongest person I've ever known. You've survived things that would have destroyed anyone else. You can survive this."

*The knots,* her eyes said. *The writing in my skin. It won't let me stop.*

I looked at the patterns covering her body. At the Yllish magic carved into her flesh. At the chains that bound her to the song.

And then I saw something else.

Beneath Cinder's carved commands, woven through them like hidden threads, there were other patterns. Smaller. Subtler. Written in faded ink rather than scarred into skin. Counter-knots. Negations. Anchors.

Her own words.

The patterns she'd been writing in secret for months, preparing for exactly this moment.

"Denna," I breathed. "Your patterns—"

*I know,* her eyes said. And for just a moment, behind the desperation, I saw something else.

Determination.

The song wasn't just in her voice anymore.

It was in her blood.

In her body.

In the very substance of what she was.

To silence the song, I would have to silence her.

---

"Kvothe."

Simmon's voice. He was standing at the edge of the glowing floor, Devi and Fela beside him, all of them battered and bloodied from fighting their way through the chaos.

"Kvothe, what are you doing?"

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer.

Because I knew what I had to do.

And I knew I couldn't do it.

---

Denna's song reached its climax.

The last note hung in the air—pure, beautiful, devastating. The crack in reality pulsed with it, responding to the final word of a spell three thousand years in the making.

And then—

Something changed.

The Yllish knots on Denna's skin began to burn—not just Cinder's carved commands, but the other patterns too. Her patterns. The counter-knots she'd been hiding for months, the negations written in ink beneath his scars, the anchors she'd placed to remind herself who she truly was.

They blazed with sudden light.

And Denna screamed.

Not a note of the song. Not a commanded utterance. A scream of pure will, of defiance, of a woman who had been caged for too long finally shattering her chains.

The carved words on her skin writhed, twisted—and began to crack.

"You don't own me," she gasped, her voice raw and ragged and entirely her own. Blood ran from her nose, her ears, from the corners of her eyes. But she was smiling. "You never owned me. You owned a mask. A performance. A lie I let you believe."

The Yllish commands Cinder had carved into her flesh were fighting her counter-patterns—his writing against hers, his will against hers. Everywhere they clashed, light poured through.

"He thought he was so clever," she breathed, and there was triumph in her voice even as her body shook with the effort. "Writing on me. Making me his instrument. But I learned his language, Kvothe. I learned it, and I used it against him. Every command he gave me, I wrote a question. Every *must*, I answered with *maybe*. Every chain, I weakened link by link."

The door stopped opening.

For a moment, everything was still. The darkness beyond the crack seemed to freeze. The glowing patterns on the floor dimmed. Even the silence around me paused, waiting, watching.

Denna had stopped singing.

Not because the song was over.

Not because she couldn't resist Cinder's control.

Because she had broken it. Shattered it. Torn it apart with months of secret preparation and a lifetime of refusing to be owned.

"Kvothe." Her voice was ragged, broken, barely a whisper—but it was hers. Entirely, completely, gloriously hers. "I'm free. For the first time since Severen, I'm actually free."

"Denna—"

"Listen to me." Blood was still running down her face, but her eyes were clear. Clearer than I'd seen them in years. The Yllish knots on her skin were still visible, but they were dead now—burned out, powerless, nothing but scars. "The song has to end. It has to. If it doesn't, the door will stay open. Everything will come through."

"I'll find another way—"

"There is no other way." She smiled—not the sad, defeated smile of a woman being controlled, but the fierce, brilliant smile of a woman who had finally won her war. "But this is MY choice now. Not his command. Not his ritual. Mine. Do you understand? This is the first real choice I've made in months. Maybe years."

"I won't let you—"

"You can't stop me." She laughed—actually laughed, even as the door behind her pulsed with darkness. "That's what makes it real. That's what makes it work. The seal needs a willing sacrifice, remember? And I am willing. Not because he made me willing. Because I choose to be."

Her hand rose, trembling, and touched my face.

"He thought he owned me, Kvothe. He was wrong. I was always going to find a way free. I was always going to make this choice myself." Tears streamed down her face, but she was still smiling. "This isn't his victory. It's mine. My final song. My decision. My sacrifice."

"Denna, please—"

"Tell me you love me. One last time. So I know it was real."

I was crying. When had I started crying?

"I love you. I've always loved you. And I will love you forever, in whatever comes after, in whatever world—"

"Then let me do this." Her eyes met mine—clear, determined, free. "Let me choose. For the first time in so long, let me choose."

The remnants of Cinder's knots tried to reassert themselves, tried to force the final note from her throat. But they were broken things now, powerless echoes of the control they'd once held. Denna's counter-patterns had done their work.

She was free.

And she was choosing.

I looked at the woman I loved.

At the silence inside me, waiting.

At the impossible choice that had been waiting for me my whole life.

And I made my decision.
