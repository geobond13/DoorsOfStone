I DIDN'T GO back to my rooms.

I couldn't. The walls felt too close, the ceiling too low, the familiar space suddenly foreign and confining. So I climbed. Up the drainage pipes of Mains, across the treacherous span between buildings, to the high rooftops where only idiots and dreamers ventured.

The wind was cold. Good. I needed cold. Needed something to cut through the numbness spreading through my chest.

I found my usual spot—a flat section of slate hidden behind a chimney, where the shadows gathered even in daylight. I sat with my back against the warm stones and watched the stars wheel overhead, and I tried to understand what had happened.

Denna was in trouble. That much was clear. Whatever her patron was doing to her, whatever magic she was tangled in, it was consuming her. I'd seen it in her eyes, in the tremor of her hands, in the desperate edge beneath her words.

And I'd made it worse. Instead of helping, I'd pushed. Accused. Demanded answers she couldn't give. I'd been so focused on being *right* that I'd forgotten to be *kind*.

"You're heavy tonight."

Auri's voice came from somewhere above me. I looked up to find her perched on the chimney cap, her legs dangling over the edge, her silver hair catching starlight like spun glass.

"How did you know I was here?"

"The moon told me." She slid down from her perch, landing beside me with the easy grace of a falling feather. "She said you were carrying too much. That you needed someone to help you set it down."

"I'm not sure I can."

"Can't or won't?"

The words hit me like an echo. Denna had said the same thing, just hours ago.

"Both," I said. "Maybe."

Auri settled beside me, close enough that I could feel the warmth of her body, far enough that we weren't quite touching. She smelled like lavender and old libraries and something deeper—something that didn't have a name.

"Tell me about her," she said.

"Who?"

"The one who hurt you. The one you hurt back."

I didn't ask how she knew. Auri knew things. She always had. It was part of what made her beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.

"Her name is Denna," I said. "And I didn't hurt her. Not on purpose."

"The best hurts are never on purpose." Auri pulled her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them. "That's what makes them hurt the most. Because we can't even blame the person who did it."

"I tried to help her. She's involved in something dangerous—someone is using her for—"

"You tried to save her."

"Yes."

"That's different from helping." She turned to look at me, and in the darkness her eyes seemed to glow with an inner light. "Helping is what you do when someone asks. Saving is what you do when you're afraid. When you need them to be safe so you can feel safe."

"That's not fair."

"Nothing is fair. That's why we have to be kind instead."

I didn't have an answer for that. So I sat in silence, watching the stars, feeling the weight of my failures pressing down on my chest like stones.

"There's a door in the Underthing," Auri said eventually. "Old. Older than the University. Older than almost anything."

"What kind of door?"

"The kind that doesn't open. That hasn't opened for so long it's forgotten what opening feels like." She rested her chin on her knees. "I visit it sometimes. Just to remind it that someone remembers."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you keep looking for doors to open." Her voice was very soft. "That's what you do. Find the locked things and pick them until they give up their secrets. But some doors are locked for reasons. Some doors are locked from the inside."

"And if what's inside needs help?"

"Then maybe..." She paused, choosing her words with the careful precision of someone handling something fragile. "Maybe instead of picking the lock, you should sit beside it. Let it know you're there. Let it know it can open when it's ready."

I thought about Denna. About the way she'd pulled away every time I got too close to the truth. The way her walls went up the moment I tried to tear them down.

"What if it never opens?"

"Then it doesn't." Auri shrugged, a surprisingly casual gesture. "Not every door is meant for us. Not every secret wants to be known. And trying to force them open..." She trailed off, her face going distant.

"What happens?"

"Bad things." She wrapped her arms tighter around her legs. "The doors break. The things inside get out. Or the person doing the forcing gets pulled in and the door closes behind them forever."

"Is that what happened to you?"

The question slipped out before I could stop it. Auri went very still.

"I found a door," she said finally. "A long time ago. I thought I was strong enough to open it. I thought what was inside would want to come out." She shook her head. "I was wrong. The door opened, but it wasn't what I expected. And by the time I understood, I was already through."

"Through to where?"

She looked at me, and for a moment she was utterly present—more *there* than I'd ever seen her. "Here. Where names mean different things. Where people forget how to be people. Where the broken pieces can be safe because nobody expects them to be whole."

"Auri..."

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Don't try to save me. I saved myself, a long time ago. The only thing left is learning to be happy with what remains."

We sat in silence as the moon tracked across the sky. Somewhere in the city below, a clock chimed the late hours. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of autumn leaves and distant smoke.

"She loves you," Auri said.

"What?"

"The door. The one you're trying to force open." She uncurled herself, stretching like a cat in a patch of sunlight. "She loves you. That's why she's locked so tight. She's afraid that if she opens, everything will come pouring out and there won't be anything left."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know what that looks like." She stood, brushing dust from her ragged dress. "And because she told me. Once. Before you came back."

"Denna talked to you?"

"She came looking for you. Found me instead." Auri smiled—a sad, knowing expression. "She asked me to take care of you. To make sure you didn't do anything stupid while she was gone."

"Gone where?"

But Auri was already climbing, scaling the chimney with the sure-footed grace of a creature born to darkness.

"Wait—" I scrambled to my feet. "Auri, where did she go?"

"Where doors go when they're ready to close forever." Her voice drifted down from somewhere above. "But you can still catch her, if you hurry. If you stop trying to save her and start trying to love her instead."

"I don't understand—"

"You will." A pause. Then, softer: "Or you won't. And either way, the door will close. Some doors only close, Kvothe. Remember that."

She vanished into the night, leaving me alone on the rooftop with the wind and the stars and the growing certainty that I'd already made a choice I couldn't take back.

I didn't hurry.

That's what haunts me most. I had the chance—I felt the urgency of Auri's words, knew that something was building toward a breaking point—and I still didn't move. I told myself I needed time to think. Time to plan. Time to figure out the *right* approach.

Pride. Always pride.

By the time I went looking for Denna, she was gone. Her rooms at the inn were empty, her patrons at the Eolian hadn't seen her in days. Even Threpe—who knew everything about everyone—could only shrug and suggest she'd moved on to another city, another patron, another life.

But I knew better. She hadn't moved on.

She'd moved *in*. Deeper into whatever her patron was building. Deeper into the song and the knots and the terrible transformation I'd glimpsed in her eyes.

And I let her go. Because I was too proud to chase. Too hurt to admit that she might have been right about me.

Some doors only close.

I should have listened.

"Reshi."

Bast's voice pulled me back to the present. The Waystone Inn, the grey morning light, the patient scratch of Chronicler's pen.

"That was the turning point," the innkeeper said. His voice was flat, drained. "If I'd gone after her that night. If I'd found her before she—" He stopped. Drew a breath.

"Before she what?" Chronicler asked.

"Before she finished becoming what he made her. Before the knots closed around her heart." The innkeeper looked down at his hands—still on the bar, still motionless. "There was a window. A moment where I could have reached her, could have pulled her back from the edge. And I spent it on the rooftops, feeling sorry for myself."

"You couldn't have known—"

"No." The word was sharp enough to cut. "I *could* have known. Auri told me, plain as anything. 'Some doors only close.' I just didn't listen."

He picked up his cloth, began to wipe the bar again. That endless, meaningless motion that seemed to be the only thing keeping him anchored.

"The next time I saw Denna," he said quietly, "the door was already closed. And all that was left was learning how to live with what came through it."
