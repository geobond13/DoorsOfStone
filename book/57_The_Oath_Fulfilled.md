PEACE DOESN'T LAST.

I should have known that. Did know it, somewhere beneath the relief of returning home. But I let myself pretend otherwise for a few months. Let myself believe that the worst was over, that surviving Renere and the doors and the transformation of everything I'd loved was the end of the story.

It wasn't. It was barely the beginning.

The University welcomed me back with the wary eyes of people who had heard rumors. Not the truth—the truth would have been too strange to believe—but fragments. Whispers. Stories that painted me as either hero or monster, depending on who was telling them.

I tried to settle into my old routines. Lectures with Elodin, who studied me with knowing eyes but asked no questions. Sessions in the Fishery with Manet, who seemed to sense that I wasn't quite the same person who had left. Evenings at Anker's, where the music felt different now—hollow somehow, like an echo of what it had been.

The silence was always there. Quiet now, controlled, but present. A companion I hadn't asked for, living in the spaces between my thoughts.

---

The first sign came from Ambrose.

Not directly—he was too careful for that. Too aware of what I'd become, or at least of what people said I'd become. But rumors began circulating within weeks of my return. Stories about me. About what I'd done in Renere. About the magical explosion that had killed hundreds and left the great hall in ruins.

"They're calling you a terrorist," Simmon said, his face pale. We sat in a corner of the Eolian, far from the stage where a second-rate lutist was murdering a ballad. "There are warrants being issued. The Maer's people are asking questions."

"The Maer knows what happened." I kept my voice steady, though my hands wanted to shake. "He was there. He saw Cinder, saw the doors, saw everything."

"The Maer is dead."

The words hit me like a physical blow. My fingers went numb around my mug, and I set it down before I could drop it.

"What?"

"Three weeks ago. The poisoning finally finished him." Simmon's voice cracked on the last word. "He lingered for a while, they say. Holding on. But whatever happened at the ball—the strain was too much. His body gave out."

I thought of Alveron. Of his sharp mind and sharper tongue. Of the games he'd played with me, testing and probing, trying to decide if I was useful or dangerous. Of the night he'd given me the Maer's mercy, letting me leave Severen alive when he could have had me executed.

He'd been a hard man, sometimes cruel. But he'd been fair. And in the end, he'd tried to help.

"And Meluan is blaming you," Simmon continued. "Saying you conspired with the dark forces that attacked the ball. That you're responsible for everything." He gripped my arm, his fingers digging in hard enough to bruise. "Kvothe, they're coming for you. There's a bounty on your head—a thousand talents, dead or alive."

"I saved the world."

"No one knows that. All they know is what they saw—explosions, death, a man at the center of it all who disappeared before anyone could question him." Simmon shook his head, and I saw tears gathering in his eyes. "The narrative has already been written. And you're the villain."

I wanted to argue. To explain. To make him understand that everything I'd done had been necessary, that the alternative was the end of everything.

But I knew how stories worked. I'd been a storyteller all my life.

Once the narrative was set, it was almost impossible to change.

The second sign came from Cinder.

Not in person—I hadn't seen him since the mountain, since those strange weeks of teaching and learning and transformation. But his influence was spreading. Creeping across the land like a shadow, or like a disease.

Villages touched by silence. Not destroyed—that would have been too obvious, too dramatic. Just... changed. Towns where music no longer worked properly, where instruments went flat no matter how carefully they were tuned. Places where speech came with difficulty, where conversations trailed off into uncomfortable quiet.

A creeping wrongness that ate at the edges of the world.

"He's building something," Devi said.

We met in her room above the shop, the same room where she'd once threatened me with malfeasance. Now she studied the patterns I'd drawn in the air—the ones Cinder had taught me, made visible through techniques I barely understood.

"A network," she continued, her sharp eyes tracing the spirals. "A web of silence that spans the Four Corners. I can see the edges of it. The places where it touches, where it connects."

"Why?"

"I don't know. But if I had to guess—" She paused, chewing her lower lip the way she did when she was thinking hard. "He's preparing for another attempt. The doors are sealed, but seals can be weakened. Given enough time, enough pressure..."

"They break."

"Everything breaks eventually." She looked at me, and I saw something in her eyes I'd rarely seen there: fear. "Including you, if you keep carrying that silence without understanding it."

"I understand it better than before."

"Do you? Or have you just learned to coexist with it?" Her voice was sharp, the way it got when she was worried and trying to hide it. "The silence you carry isn't stable, Kvothe. It's connected to the seal, to Denna, to the doors themselves. If Cinder finds a way to exploit that connection—"

"Then he has access to everything I have access to."

"Including the woman you love." Devi's eyes were hard. "You need to figure out what you're going to do. Before he figures it out for you."

The third sign was the worst.

It came at night, in the Underthing, where I'd gone to speak with Auri. She was the one person who might understand what I'd become, what I was still becoming. The one person who lived in the spaces between, the way I was learning to live.

She was waiting for me in Mantle, as always. Candles lit, a small feast laid out on clean cloth—cheese and apples and a honey cake she'd found or made somewhere in the winding passages.

But something was wrong.

Her eyes were hollow. Her movements were slow, hesitant, lacking the quick grace that usually defined her. And wrapped around her wrists, barely visible in the candlelight, were patterns I recognized.

Yllish knots.

"No," I breathed. The word came out as barely a whisper. "No, no, no—"

"He found me." Her voice was distant, dreamlike, disconnected from the fear that should have been there. "Through the paths I use. Through the doors between places." She looked at me with terrible calm. "He said to tell you: the first of three things breaks tonight."

"Auri, what did he do to you?"

"He wrote on me. Like he wrote on her." She touched the knots on her wrists, tracing them with fingers that trembled slightly. "But I'm not a bridge. I'm not a channel. I'm just..." She struggled for words, and I saw the real Auri underneath the calm—struggling, fighting, trying to break through whatever had been done to her. "A message. A warning. A demonstration of what he can do."

"I'll break the binding. I know how—"

"Too late." She began walking toward the deeper darkness, toward the passages that led to places I'd never seen. "The first thing is already broken. The second follows. And then the third."

"What things? What are you talking about?"

She stopped at the edge of the light, her small form silhouetted against the darkness.

"Your oath," she said. "To protect the innocent. To save those who couldn't save themselves. To be the hero the stories claim."

Then she stepped into the shadows.

And was gone.

---

I searched for hours.

The Underthing was vast—miles of tunnels, countless chambers, doors that led to places I'd never seen. But Auri knew its paths better than anyone. She'd lived here for years, mapping routes and passages, understanding the logic of a labyrinth that had no logic.

If she didn't want to be found...

I returned to the surface at dawn, empty-handed and desperate. My clothes were torn from squeezing through narrow passages. My hands were scraped and bleeding from climbing. And in my chest, where the silence lived, I felt something new.

Guilt. Heavy and hot and inescapable.

I'd failed her. The way I'd failed Denna. The way I'd failed everyone who trusted me.

Simmon was waiting at the entrance to the Underthing, his face gray in the early light.

"She's gone," I said, before he could speak. "Cinder took her. Marked her with the same patterns he used on Denna."

"There's more." His face was ashen. "While you were underground—news came from Vintas. Meluan has declared you an enemy of the realm. She's offering ten thousand talents for your capture."

"I don't care about—"

"And Kilvin is dead."

The world stopped.

For a moment, I couldn't hear anything. Couldn't feel anything. The silence inside me expanded, filling every space, drowning every thought.

"What?"

"An accident. An explosion in the Artificery." Simmon's voice shook, and I saw him fighting to stay composed. "He was working on something—protective equipment, he said, in case you needed to face Cinder again. Something went wrong. The whole workshop..."

"That's not an accident."

"No. It isn't." Simmon met my eyes, and I saw the same realization there that was crystallizing in my own mind. "The first of three things. Auri, marked and vanished. Kilvin, dead in an explosion. What's the third, Kvothe? What else does he want to take from you?"

I didn't know.

But I was going to find out.

---

The answer came that evening.

I was in my room at Anker's, preparing to leave—where, I didn't know. Just away. Away from the University that couldn't protect me anymore. Away from the friends who were becoming targets. Away from everything I'd built, everything I'd worked for, everything that made me who I was.

There was a knock at the door.

I opened it with the silence ready, coiled inside me like a weapon. If it was an assassin, if it was someone come to collect the bounty—

Wil stood there, a letter in his hand. His face was the color of old parchment.

"This came for you," he said. "Delivered by a messenger who wouldn't say who sent him. Wouldn't say anything, actually. Just handed it over and walked away."

I took the letter. The seal was unfamiliar—or rather, it was familiar in the wrong way. A circle containing a word in a language I couldn't read, but whose meaning I understood anyway.

Silence.

I broke the seal.

*The third thing you swore to protect,* it read, in handwriting that was precise and elegant and utterly inhuman, *is already mine. The woman you called mother died thinking of you. The woman you call friend disappears into darkness. And the woman you love is trapped in a seal of my design.*

*Three oaths. Three breaks. Three prices for your interference.*

*Come to me, Kvothe. Or watch everyone you care about suffer for your choices.*

*—Ferule*

I read it twice. Then a third time, looking for hidden meanings, for tricks, for some way the words could mean something other than what they seemed to mean.

There was nothing. Just the simple, brutal truth.

Then I looked at Wil.

"He has Denna," I said. "Not her body—she is the seal. But somehow, he's found a way to hurt her. To reach her through the binding."

"What are you going to do?"

I thought of Auri, marked and running. Of Kilvin, dead in an explosion that shouldn't have happened. Of Denna, trapped between worlds, suffering because of me.

I thought of the oath I'd sworn, long ago, in a language older than memory. To protect. To save. To be better than the world expected me to be.

I'd failed that oath. Failed it completely and utterly and irredeemably.

But maybe—just maybe—I could still make it mean something.

"Face him," I said. "End this. Whatever it costs."

I gathered what I needed. Not much—the silence I carried, the knowledge I'd gained, the connections I couldn't sever even if I'd wanted to.

And I walked toward the door.

Toward Cinder.

Toward the end of everything.

Or perhaps, if I was very lucky, toward a new beginning.
