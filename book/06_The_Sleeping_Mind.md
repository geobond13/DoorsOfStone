ELODIN'S ROOMS WERE exactly as I remembered them—which is to say, nothing like what anyone would expect from a Master Namer.

No mystical symbols on the walls. No ancient tomes scattered across mysterious surfaces. Just a comfortable mess of ordinary things: worn furniture, mismatched cups, a collection of smooth stones arranged in patterns that might have meant something or might have been purely decorative.

The Master Namer himself sat cross-legged on the floor, apparently engaged in a staring contest with a potted plant.

"You're late," he said, without looking up.

"I wasn't aware we had an appointment."

"We didn't. But you were going to come anyway, and you should have come sooner." He finally turned to face me, and his eyes were sharp despite his casual posture. "Sit. We have things to discuss."

I sat.

"Show me," he said.

"Show you what?"

"Don't be coy. The thing you learned in the Fae. The name that's been following you around like a shadow." He gestured impatiently. "Show me."

I closed my eyes. Reached for the place where names lived—the sleeping mind, he'd called it once. The part of us that sees truth without the interference of thought.

The name came slowly. Not wind, not fire. Something deeper. Something that felt like the moment between heartbeats, the space between notes.

When I opened my mouth, nothing came out.

*Silence.*

Not absence of sound—*presence* of silence. The room went still in a way that felt intentional, weighted, complete.

Elodin's eyes went wide.

"Stop," he whispered. "Stop it now."

I let the name go. The silence retreated, replaced by the ordinary quiet of a room with two people breathing in it.

"Do you know what you just did?" His voice was strange. Almost frightened. "Do you have any idea—"

"I named silence."

"You named *Silence*." He said it differently—capitalized, significant. "The anti-name. The unmaking word. Do you know how many namers in history have been able to speak it?"

"How many?"

"Seven." He stood, pacing now. "Seven in three thousand years. And most of them are remembered as monsters."

"Why?"

He stopped. Looked at me with an expression I couldn't read.

"Because silence doesn't discriminate. It takes everything. Sound, vibration, breath, heartbeat. Speak it wrong, speak it too fully, and you don't just quiet a room." He paused. "You quiet everything in it. Permanently."

I thought of my mother. Of the way she sang. Of the silence that had followed when the Chandrian finished their work.

"Why would I be able to name it?"

"I don't know." Elodin sat back down, heavily. "But I can guess. You lost something, once. Something precious. And the silence that followed... it marked you. Shaped you. Made you into someone who could speak its name."

"My parents."

"Yes." His voice softened. "Loss creates namers, Kvothe. Always has. We find the names of the things that wounded us, because the wound becomes a kind of knowing."

We talked for hours.

I told him about Ademre. About Felurian. About the things I'd seen and felt and learned in the months I'd been gone. He listened without interrupting, his eyes distant, processing.

When I mentioned the Cthaeh, his face went pale. We'd already discussed this, but he seemed no less disturbed by the repetition.

"Everything it told you was designed to cause maximum harm," he said. "Every piece of information was a trap."

"So you've said."

"And you're still going to follow the threads it gave you."

"I don't have a choice."

"There's always a choice." But his voice lacked conviction. "The problem is, all the choices lead to the same place when the Cthaeh is involved."

"Then help me make the best of bad options."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, walked to his bookshelf, and pulled out a slim volume bound in faded leather.

"Read this," he said, pressing it into my hands. "Carefully. Between the lines. And then burn it, because if anyone finds it in your possession, you'll wish the Sithe had gotten to you first."

I looked at the cover. No title. No author. Just a symbol embossed in the leather—a tower, broken, with light spilling from the cracks.

"What is it?"

"A history. The only true one." He moved toward the door, clearly ending our conversation. "It won't tell you what you want to know. But it might help you understand why the questions you're asking are so dangerous."

"Elodin—"

"Go. Read. Think. And for the love of all the gods, don't do anything stupid until we've talked again." He paused at the door. "The name of silence is a weapon, Kvothe. One of the most powerful in existence. Learn to control it before someone makes you use it."

"Before someone makes me—"

But he was gone, the door swinging shut behind him, leaving me alone with a book that had no title and a warning that made less sense the more I thought about it.

I read the book that night.

It wasn't what I expected. No grand revelations, no secret histories of the Amyr or the Chandrian. Just a story—seemingly simple—about a king who loved his people too much.

The king had a kingdom that was threatened by shadows. Not metaphorical shadows—real darkness, spreading from the edges of the world. His advisors told him to fight, to build walls, to prepare for war.

Instead, he made a choice.

He took the darkness into himself. Drew it inside, wrapped it around his soul, became a vessel for the very thing that threatened his people. And in doing so, he saved them—but he also became something else. Something that couldn't live among them anymore. Something that had to stand apart, forever, holding the darkness inside so it couldn't spread.

The book called him Lanre.

But the story didn't match the stories I'd grown up with. In this version, Lanre wasn't a monster. He was a hero who had made an impossible choice. Who had become darkness so that others could have light.

And the Chandrian—the Seven who followed him—weren't villains. They were guardians. The chains that kept the door closed. The price that had to be paid, over and over, so that the world could continue to exist.

If the book was true, then everything I believed about my parents' death was wrong.

If the book was true, then the Chandrian weren't murderers. They were protectors.

And I was hunting the people who had been keeping me safe.

I burned the book at dawn, as Elodin had instructed.

But the words stayed with me. The questions multiplied. And somewhere in the back of my mind, the name of silence stirred, waiting for the moment when I would need to speak it.

Waiting for the moment when speaking it would destroy everything.
