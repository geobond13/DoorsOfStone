CINDER DIDN'T DIE.

He dissolved.

The name of silence, spoken with everything I had left, unmade him. Not killed—unmade. Erased. As if he'd never existed at all.

Three thousand years of life. Of plotting and scheming and hurting. All of it reduced to nothing.

And when it was over, when the echoes of the unmaking faded, I collapsed on the stone floor of the sanctuary.

Empty.

*Kvothe?*

Denna's voice, faint in the distance.

*I'm here.*

*He's gone. I felt him... stop existing.*

*Yes.*

*Are you okay?*

I didn't know how to answer.

---

The silence that remained was different.

Not hungry anymore. Not pulling or pushing or trying to consume. Just... present. A part of me, like my heart or my lungs or the memories I carried.

But something else had changed too.

I tried to call the wind.

Nothing.

I tried to play silent music.

Nothing.

The power I'd used to unmake Cinder—the combination of naming and silence that had erased him from existence—had burned out something inside me. The abilities I'd fought so hard to master, the gifts that had defined me since childhood...

Gone.

---

I lay on the stone for hours.

Maybe days. Time moved strangely in the empty sanctuary. The patterns on the walls were dark now—Cinder's death had severed their connection to whatever power had sustained them.

Eventually, I stood.

My body worked. My mind worked. I was still Kvothe, whoever that was now.

But I was also something less. Something smaller. Someone who had given everything to save the world and was left with almost nothing in return.

*Kvothe,* Denna's voice whispered. *You need to leave this place.*

*I know.*

*The sanctuary is collapsing. Without Cinder to maintain it—*

*I know.* I started walking. *I'm going.*

*Where?*

*I don't know. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere I can figure out what I am now.*

A pause. Then: *I'm sorry. For what this cost you.*

*Don't be. The cost was mine to pay.*

*But—*

*I'd pay it again,* I said. *A thousand times. For you. For everyone.*

Silence. But not the empty kind.

The kind that contains everything that doesn't need to be said.

---

I emerged from the mountain as the sun was setting.

The world outside looked the same—trees and sky and the distant shapes of hills. No sign that anything momentous had happened. No indication that reality had almost ended and been saved.

I walked down the mountain.

Each step felt heavier than the last. Not from exhaustion—from the weight of everything I was leaving behind. My music. My naming. The identity I'd built over seventeen years of desperate survival.

Kvothe the Bloodless.

Kvothe the Arcane.

Kvothe Six-String.

All of them, names for someone who didn't exist anymore.

I reached the base of the mountain as night fell. Made camp by a stream. Lay awake looking at the stars.

And tried to figure out what came next.

---

The answer came from an unexpected source.

Auri appeared on the third day.

She walked out of the forest as if she'd been there all along, the Yllish knots on her wrists faded but still visible. She sat beside me without speaking, watching the stream flow past.

"You broke him," she said finally.

"I unmade him."

"Same thing. Different words." She looked at me with ancient eyes. "You unmade part of yourself too."

"I know."

"Does it hurt?"

"Not the way I expected." I picked up a pebble, turned it in my fingers. "I thought losing the music would kill me. But it's more like... a phantom limb. I can feel where it used to be. I just can't use it anymore."

"The silence is still there."

"Different now. Quiet instead of hungry." I met her eyes. "How are you here? The binding Cinder placed on you—"

"Broke when he did. I felt it snap." She smiled—the first genuine smile I'd seen from her since before everything began. "I'm me again. Whole. The way I used to be."

"Good."

"Yes." She stood. "Come with me."

"Where?"

"Somewhere safe. Somewhere you can rest while you figure out who you are now." She extended her hand. "The world is still dangerous, Kvothe. And you're not the fighter you used to be."

I took her hand.

Let her lead me into the forest.

Toward whatever came next.
