THE WORLD WAS COMING APART.

I didn't notice it at first—too focused on the road ahead, too wrapped in my own thoughts. But as I traveled deeper into Vintas, the signs became impossible to ignore.

Refugees on the roads. Entire families carrying everything they owned, moving away from something they couldn't name. When I asked where they were going, they shook their heads. Anywhere else. Anywhere that felt *right*. The places they'd lived for generations didn't feel safe anymore.

Soldiers marching under banners I didn't recognize. Not the Maer's colors—something newer. Something that smelled of iron and authority and the kind of faith that didn't ask questions. They were conscripting as they went, taking young men from villages that could barely spare them.

And at night, in the darkness beyond my campfire, things moved.

Not Scrael—I'd have recognized those. These were different. Shadows that didn't quite match the trees that cast them. Sounds that might have been wind, or might have been voices speaking languages that predated words. The feeling, constant and growing, that something vast and patient was watching from just beyond the edge of sight.

The binding was cracking. I could feel it now—a wrongness in the world, like a string pulled too tight, vibrating with the tension of imminent breaking.

And I was running *toward* the breaking point.

---

I stopped in a village whose name I never learned.

The inn was half-empty, the remaining patrons huddled around their drinks with the desperate focus of people trying not to think. The innkeeper was a thin man with worried eyes who served me without small talk and pocketed my coins without counting them.

"Bad times," was all he said.

I ate in silence, listening to the fragments of conversation around me. The King's celebration was all anyone talked about—the grand event in Renere, the engagement to the Jakis girl, the hope that perhaps this alliance would bring stability to a kingdom that felt increasingly unstable.

"They say he's invited everyone who matters," one man said. "Every noble family, every merchant prince. Even some of the University masters."

"Fat lot of good that'll do," another replied. "You can't fix what's wrong with pretty parties and political marriages."

"What *is* wrong?"

Silence. The kind of silence that meant everyone knew the answer but nobody wanted to say it out loud.

I finished my meal and went to my room. Sleep came slowly, and when it did, it brought dreams of doors. Doors opening. Doors closing. Doors that led to darkness so complete it felt like death.

I woke before dawn, sweating despite the cold, and started riding before the sun cleared the horizon.

---

Three days from Renere, I found a body.

It was a soldier—one of the conscripts, judging by his cheap armor and the fear still frozen on his face. He hadn't died in battle. There were no wounds I could see, no blood on his clothes.

He'd died of terror.

I didn't examine him closely. I didn't want to see what his eyes had been looking at when his heart gave out. I just covered him with my cloak, said a prayer to whatever gods might still be listening, and kept riding.

The road grew more crowded as I approached the capital. Merchants and nobles and common folk, all streaming toward Renere for the celebration. They traveled in groups now—nobody wanted to be alone on the roads. And they moved quickly, glancing over their shoulders, hurrying toward the lights of the city as if brightness alone could keep the darkness at bay.

I joined the flow of traffic, letting myself be carried along. My hand kept straying to the sword at my hip—Caesura, the poet-killer. The blade I'd earned in Ademre, that had been given its name by a woman who saw what it would do.

What it would do. Not what it could do.

I tried not to think about what that meant.

---

Renere appeared on the horizon like a jewel set against grey skies.

I'd heard the stories, of course. Everyone had. The greatest city in Vintas, perhaps in all the Four Corners. Towers of white stone that caught the light. Gardens that bloomed in every season. Streets so clean you could eat from them.

The stories were true. Even from a distance, the city took my breath away. After weeks of grey roads and frightened villages, Renere looked like something from a dream. A promise that beauty still existed, that civilization still mattered, that the darkness gathering at the edges of the world hadn't won yet.

I almost believed it.

---

Getting into the city was easy. Getting into the celebration would be harder.

I spent my first day in Renere gathering information. The King's engagement celebration was the only thing anyone talked about—three days of festivities, culminating in a grand ball at the palace. Every noble in Vintas would be there. Every diplomat, every merchant, every player of the beautiful game.

And Cinder. Somewhere in that crowd, wearing a human face, Cinder would be waiting.

I didn't know what he looked like. That was the problem. I'd seen him once, in the firelight of my burning home, and the memory had faded to nightmare fragments—white hair, black eyes, a smile that promised suffering. He could be anyone. A servant. A noble. A musician, like me.

But Denna would know him. Denna, who was somewhere in the city, preparing for whatever role he'd written for her. If I could find her, I could find him.

If I could find her before the binding broke.

---

I found her the night before the ball.

She was staying in a house near the palace—not an inn, but a private residence that someone important had loaned to someone else important. I didn't ask questions. I just waited in the shadows until I saw movement in one of the upper windows.

She came to the door when I knocked. She was wearing a gown I'd never seen before—dark blue, embroidered with silver thread in patterns that caught the light strangely. Her hair was down, the elaborate braids temporarily removed.

And I could see the inscriptions.

Lines of Yllish writing, traced across her shoulders and down her arms. They glowed faintly in the lamplight, shifting and pulsing like something alive. Words I couldn't read. Commands I couldn't understand. A language older than Ergen, written on the skin of the woman I loved.

"You shouldn't be here," she said.

"I know."

"He knows you're coming. He's counting on it."

"I know that too."

She stepped aside, letting me in. The house was quiet, elegant, empty. Whoever owned it had left for the evening, or perhaps for good. The kind of departure that happens when you know something terrible is coming.

"The ball is tomorrow," she said. "The song is ready. I'm ready." She laughed—bitter, broken. "As ready as I'll ever be."

"Don't do this."

"I don't have a choice." She touched her arm, where the inscriptions glowed brightest. "The patterns are complete. When I sing tomorrow, they'll activate. The binding will shift. And whatever happens after that..." She shook her head. "I don't know. Nobody does. This has never been done before."

"Then let me stop him. Tell me where he is."

"He's everywhere. Nowhere. He moves through the shadows like he was born in them." She looked at me, and there was something in her eyes I couldn't read. "But he'll be at the ball. I can promise you that. When I sing, he'll be watching."

"Then I'll find him there."

"You'll die there."

"Maybe."

We stood in silence, the lamplight flickering between us. So much to say. So little time to say it.

"I'm sorry," I said finally. "For everything. For pushing you away. For not listening when you tried to explain. For being so focused on being right that I forgot to be kind."

"I'm sorry too." Her voice cracked. "For not telling you the truth. For letting him use me. For thinking I could play this game and walk away unchanged."

"We're a pair, aren't we? Two brilliant fools who couldn't see what was right in front of them."

"The best kind." She smiled—sad, beautiful, heartbreaking. "At least we'll go down together."

I reached out and took her hand. The inscriptions pulsed against my palm, warm and alive and terrible.

"I love you," I said. "I should have told you that a long time ago."

"I know." Her fingers tightened around mine. "I've always known. That's why this hurts so much."

We stood there, holding hands in the lamplight, while the night grew darker and the shadows grew longer and somewhere in the city, a monster prepared for his triumph.

Tomorrow, everything would change.

Tomorrow, I would find out what kind of story I was in.
