BREDON FOUND ME in the stables.

I was arranging horses for the journey back to the University, checking saddles and counting provisions, when his distinctive white-capped figure appeared in the doorway. His silver-topped walking stick caught the afternoon light, throwing a thin bar of brilliance across the straw-covered floor.

"Leaving so soon?" His voice carried that cultivated mildness I had come to associate with him—pleasant as summer rain, and just as hard to predict. "Without saying goodbye?"

"The Maer's poisoner can't be caught here." I cinched a strap tighter than necessary. "The source is elsewhere. I need to return to the University."

"Do you?" He stepped into the stable, and I noticed—perhaps for the first time—how carefully he moved. Not the caution of age. The precision of a predator who has learned to seem harmless. "And here I thought we might have one last game of Tak."

"I don't have time for games."

"You always have time for games, Kvothe." He smiled—that knowing expression that had charmed and unsettled me in equal measure since our first meeting. "That's what I admire about you. You understand that games are never just games. They're practice. Training. Preparation for the real conflicts."

Something in his voice made me pause. My hands stilled on the horse's flank.

"What do you want, Bredon?"

"To help you." He moved closer, his footsteps barely whispering against the straw. "You're looking for answers about the doors. About what's happening to the Maer. About the song that's changing the world." He stopped a few feet away, close enough that I could smell the faint lavender of his soap. "I can give you those answers. But first, you need to listen."

"I've been listening all night. Meluan told me—"

"Meluan told you what the Lackless family knows. Which is considerable, but incomplete." His eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw something ancient behind them. Something patient and calculating, hidden beneath decades of careful performance. "I can tell you what the Amyr know."

The words hung in the air like smoke from a snuffed candle.

"You're Amyr."

"I am what remains of the Amyr." He leaned on his walking stick, suddenly looking his age—or perhaps allowing himself to look it. "Not the painted soldiers the Tehlins pretend to honor. Not the knights in children's stories. The real Amyr, who have been working to prevent catastrophe for three thousand years."

---

We walked through gardens I had never seen.

Not the manicured paths where courtiers strolled and gossiped—a private space, walled and quiet, where ancient oaks cast shadows that seemed to move with purpose. Moss grew thick on stones that might have been laid before the Empire was born. The air smelled of old leaves and older secrets.

Bredon led me to a pavilion hidden among the trees, its wooden structure weathered to silver-gray, its roof thick with climbing roses long since gone to thorn. Inside, a table waited—and on the table, a Tak board.

Not the simple travel set we had used before. This board was larger, more elaborate. The wood was dark as old blood, inlaid with patterns of silver that caught the dappled light. The pieces were carved from stone—some pale as moonlight, others dark as a starless sky.

"Sit," Bredon said. "Play."

"I don't understand. If you have information—"

"Information given freely is rarely valued." He settled into the chair across from me, arranging his robes with the precision of long practice. "Information won in contest is remembered. Treasured." He gestured at the board. "Humor an old man. Play, and I will tell you everything you need to know."

I looked at the board. At the pieces waiting in their starting positions. At the man across from me who had just revealed himself as something far more dangerous than a friendly old nobleman.

"Fine." I sat. "But no holding back. If we're going to play, we play properly."

"I would expect nothing less." He reached for a white piece. "Shall I begin?"

---

The first moves of Tak are about territory.

You place your flat stones to claim space on the board, building toward a road that will connect opposite edges. The game looks simple at first—just put down pieces, try to make a line. But simplicity is a mask. Beneath it lies a depth that has consumed strategists for centuries.

Bredon placed his first stone in the center of the board. The classic opening—aggressive, commanding, demanding a response.

I countered on the edge, building toward a position that could threaten multiple approaches.

"The Amyr were never what the stories claim," Bredon said, placing his second stone. "We were never heroes. Never saints. We were pragmatists who understood that some evils must be committed to prevent greater ones."

"The greater good." I placed my stone, extending my line.

"A phrase that's been abused beyond recognition. But yes—in essence." He studied the board. "When the Creation War ended, when the doors were sealed and the broken world began to heal, someone needed to ensure the peace would last. That the seals would hold. That no one would try to open what had been closed."

"And that someone was you."

"That someone was an organization." He placed a standing stone—a capstone—blocking my advance. "A network of people across centuries, passing knowledge and responsibility from generation to generation. We didn't call ourselves Amyr at first. That name came later, when we needed to hide in plain sight."

I studied the board. The capstone changed everything. I needed to redirect, find a new path around his defense.

"Hide from whom?"

"From everyone. The people who wanted to open the doors. The people who wanted to forget they existed. The people who would have panicked if they knew what lurked behind the seals." He watched me consider my options. "Secrecy was our greatest tool. We worked invisibly, manipulating events, removing threats before they could mature."

"Removing." I placed my stone, starting a new angle of attack. "You mean killing."

"When necessary." No apology in his voice. "We burned the wrong books. Silenced the wrong scholars. Eliminated anyone who got too close to the truth."

He paused.

"Including, I'm sorry to say, your parents."

---

The world went very still.

The birds stopped singing. The wind died in the trees. Even the sunlight seemed to freeze, caught in amber, as those words sank into my understanding.

"What did you say?"

"We didn't order their deaths." Bredon's voice was careful, measured, the way you might speak to a wounded animal. "That was Cinder's work—he has his own agenda, one that doesn't align with ours. But we knew about them. Knew they were researching things that should have stayed buried." He placed another stone, his hand steady despite the weight of his confession. "We were... considering options. When the Chandrian struck first."

"You were going to kill my family."

"We were going to do whatever was necessary to protect the seals." His eyes met mine without flinching. "That's what we do, Kvothe. That's what we've always done. Not because we enjoy it. Because the alternative is worse."

I felt ice in my veins. Rage, building like a storm behind my eyes. My hand trembled as I reached for my next piece.

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you need to understand what you're dealing with. The forces in play aren't simple. The Chandrian aren't just villains. The Amyr aren't just heroes. Everyone involved has reasons for what they do—reasons that make sense from their perspective."

I placed my stone. It was a poor move—reactive, emotional, leaving gaps in my defense. But I couldn't think clearly. The man across from me had just admitted to considering my family's murder, and he expected me to keep playing a game?

"And your reason for talking to me now?"

"The situation has changed." He placed a stone that threatened my entire right flank. "The doors are opening. Whatever balance we've maintained for three millennia is failing. And we can't stop it alone."

---

We played in silence for several moves.

The game had shifted—I was on the defensive now, reacting to his threats rather than building my own. Each stone he placed seemed to anticipate my response, cutting off paths I hadn't even seen yet.

"The Chandrian," I said finally. "What do you know about them?"

"More than anyone alive, probably." He captured one of my pieces, removing it from the board with delicate precision. "They were Amyr once. Or something like Amyr—the distinction gets blurry that far back. They believed the doors should be opened. That what was sealed away should be released."

"Why?"

"Different reasons for different members." He studied the board. "Haliax—Lanre, as he was called—believed that what's behind the doors could end his suffering. Could finally grant him the death he's been denied for three thousand years."

"And Cinder?"

"Cinder has... other motivations." Bredon's voice grew colder. "More complicated ones."

"He killed my parents. He's writing on Denna like she's a page in a book. His motivations don't seem complicated to me."

"They are, though." Bredon leaned forward, and for a moment his mask of cultivated gentility slipped, revealing something harder beneath. "Cinder is a renegade. Not just from the world—from the Chandrian themselves. He's working toward an opening, yes. But not the same opening Haliax wants."

"What does that mean?"

"It means the Chandrian aren't united. They haven't been for centuries." He placed a stone that blocked my best remaining path. "Haliax leads by force of will, but several of his seven have their own agendas. Cinder is the most dangerous because his agenda might actually succeed."

I looked at the board. My position was crumbling. Every move I made opened new vulnerabilities, while his structure grew stronger with each piece.

"What is he trying to do?"

Bredon was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"He's trying to become a god."

---

The words didn't make sense at first.

"Gods don't exist." I placed a desperate blocking stone. "Not in the real world. They're stories people tell—"

"They exist." Bredon's voice carried absolute certainty. "Not the gods in the Tehlin scriptures. Those are fabrications, designed to give people comfort. But there are... beings. Entities of power that exist beyond normal understanding. And under the right circumstances, a mortal can become one of them."

"How?"

"By accumulating enough power. By changing what people believe. By reshaping reality through force of will until reality reshapes you in return." He stood, began pacing behind his chair, his walking stick tapping against the stone floor. "It's what the Shapers tried to do during the Creation War. Most of them failed. A few succeeded."

"And Cinder thinks he can do the same."

"Cinder has been working toward this for three thousand years." He returned to his seat, placing another stone with deliberate care. "Gathering power. Manipulating events. Building the framework for his ascension. The song your friend is singing—it's not just about opening the doors. It's about changing how people think about the Chandrian. About Cinder specifically."

"If enough people believe he's something more than mortal..."

"Then he becomes more than mortal." Bredon nodded. "Reality follows belief. That's the oldest magic there is. Cinder is using the doors as a catalyst. When they open, the energy released will fuel his transformation. And when he becomes whatever he's trying to become..."

"The world ends?"

"The world changes. In ways we can't predict. Ways that might make 'ending' look merciful by comparison."

I studied the board. The game was nearly lost—his stones formed an almost unbroken line across the center, while mine were scattered and disconnected.

"One question," I said.

"Ask."

"If you're Amyr—if you've been watching the world for three thousand years—why haven't you stopped this before? Why wait until the doors are already opening?"

---

Bredon was silent for a long moment.

"Because we failed." The admission seemed to cost him something. "The Amyr have been losing for decades. Our numbers are diminished. Our resources are scattered. And the opening we've spent three thousand years preventing is happening anyway."

"So you're desperate."

"Desperate enough to tell the truth. Desperate enough to recruit someone who has every reason to hate us." He looked at me with something like hope—or perhaps calculation wearing hope's mask. "You have abilities we don't, Kvothe. You've spoken to the Cthaeh. You've touched naming at levels most arcanists never reach. You have connections to both the Faen realm and the mortal world that give you unique leverage."

"You want me to join you."

"I want you to work with us. There's a difference." He held out his hand—not for shaking, but palm up, an offering. "We can't force you. We can only offer what we know and hope you'll make the right choice."

"The right choice being your choice."

"The right choice being whatever stops Cinder. Whatever keeps the doors closed. Whatever prevents the catastrophe we've been fighting against for millennia." His hand remained extended. "I'm not asking you to forgive what we've done. I'm asking you to help us fix what's been broken."

I looked at his hand. At the old man who wasn't just an old man. At the weight of history pressing down on this moment.

Then I looked at the Tak board.

"We should finish the game first."

---

Bredon smiled—the first genuine smile I'd seen from him.

"Indeed we should." He withdrew his hand and studied the board. "You're losing, you know."

"I'm aware." I examined my remaining options. His road was nearly complete—one more stone and he would connect opposite edges. My pieces were too scattered to form a coherent defense. "But I've noticed something about how you play."

"Oh?"

"You're conservative." I placed a stone that seemed random—far from his main line, distant from any obvious threat. "You build slowly. Carefully. You don't take risks unless you have to."

"And you find that... problematic?"

"I find it predictable." I placed another stone, equally distant. "You're so focused on your grand strategy that you miss the small things. The pieces that don't seem to matter."

Bredon studied the board. For the first time, his brow furrowed in something like concern.

"What are you doing?"

"Something reckless." I placed my third stone—and suddenly, impossibly, my scattered pieces connected. A road that shouldn't have existed, built from what looked like random moves, cutting across his perfect defenses. "Something you didn't anticipate."

He stared at the board. Then he laughed—a genuine, delighted sound.

"Magnificent. I've been playing this game for sixty years, and I've never seen anyone build a road like that." He leaned back in his chair. "You see patterns where others see chaos. That's exactly why we need you."

"I haven't agreed to anything."

"No. But you haven't refused, either." He gestured at the board. "The game isn't over. Neither is our conversation. Tell me—what would it take? What would convince you to work with us?"

I thought about it. About my parents. About Denna. About the doors and the Chandrian and the song that was changing the world.

"I want the truth," I said. "Not your version of it. Not what you think I need to know. The actual truth about what happened. About what's happening. About what's going to happen."

"The truth is complicated."

"Then explain it. All of it." I leaned forward. "Start with Lanre. Start with the beginning. And don't leave anything out."

Bredon studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded.

"Very well. But this will take some time. And it will change how you see... everything."

"I'm listening."

He reached for the board, carefully resetting the pieces to their starting positions.

"It began," he said, "with a love story. Like so many disasters do. It began with a man who loved too much and a woman who died too soon. It began with Lanre and Lyra, and the war that broke the world..."

He settled back in his chair, and the story began.

---

The shadows had grown long by the time Bredon finished his tale.

The Tak board sat forgotten between us, pieces scattered from a second game we'd played while he spoke. Neither of us had bothered to keep track of who was winning. The story had consumed everything else.

I sat in silence, processing what I'd heard. The truth about Lanre—not a villain, not a hero, but a broken man who loved too much. The truth about the Chandrian—not demons from legend, but the survivors of impossible choices. The truth about the doors—not prisons for monsters, but seals on wounds that had never healed.

"Now you understand," Bredon said quietly. "Now you see why simple answers don't exist. Why good and evil aren't the clean categories that stories pretend."

"The song Denna is singing—it's making people think of Lanre as a hero."

"It's making them think of him sympathetically. Which feeds into Cinder's plan." Bredon stood, gathering his walking stick. "If people see the Chandrian as misunderstood rather than monstrous, their belief shifts. And when enough belief shifts..."

"The seals weaken."

"And Cinder gets what he wants." He moved toward the pavilion's entrance. "But belief can shift in other directions, too. If someone were to tell a different story—a truer story—then the seal might strengthen instead of weaken."

"You want me to write a counter-song."

"I want you to tell the truth. And make it beautiful enough that people want to believe it." He paused in the doorway. "You're one of the best musicians alive, Kvothe. If anyone can outshine Cinder's propaganda, it's you."

"I don't know enough. I only know pieces."

"Then let me give you more." He reached into his robes and withdrew something—a small book, leather-bound, its pages yellowed with age. "A journal. Written by one of the original Amyr, in the years after the sealing. It contains his account of what truly happened—and instructions for how the seals might be reinforced."

I took the book carefully. The leather was cracked, the binding loose, but the pages inside were still legible.

"Why give this to me?"

"Because I've given you everything I can. The rest is up to you." He stepped through the doorway, then paused. "We're not allies, Kvothe. I won't pretend we are. But for now, our goals align. That's enough."

"And when they stop aligning?"

"Then we'll be enemies again." He smiled—thin, tired, ancient. "But hopefully by then, the doors will be sealed and it won't matter."

He began walking toward the estate.

"Bredon."

He stopped.

"Thank you." The words felt strange in my mouth. "For the truth. For the game. For... all of it."

"Don't thank me yet." He didn't turn around. "The truth I've given you comes with a weight. A responsibility. And the decisions you make from here will shape the fate of everything."

He walked on, vanishing into the gathering dusk.

I sat alone in the pavilion, the journal in my hands, the Tak board before me, the story of Lanre and Lyra echoing in my mind.

Then I opened the book and began to read.
