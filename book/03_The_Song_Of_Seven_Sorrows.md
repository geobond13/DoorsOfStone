I HEARD HER before I saw her.

The Eolian was crowded that night—one of Threpe's gatherings, poets and musicians pressing shoulder to shoulder, wine flowing like water. I'd come to play, to remind Imre that Kvothe the Arcane hadn't vanished forever. But when I pushed through the door, my lute still strapped to my back, I heard a voice that stopped me cold.

Denna.

She stood on the stage, alone in the light of a dozen candles. Her dark hair fell past her shoulders in elaborate braids—not the simple style I remembered, but something more complex. More deliberate. And her voice...

Her voice had always been beautiful. But this was different. This was *power*.

*"He was a lord of ancient line,*
*Whose love for her burned like the sun.*
*But shadows crept into his mind,*
*And tragedy could not be undone..."*

The song washed over the crowd like a wave. I saw people lean forward, eyes glazing with the particular look of those caught in something larger than themselves. It was beautiful—achingly, terrifyingly beautiful. And wrong. Something about it was deeply, fundamentally wrong.

I pushed closer to the stage, ignoring the complaints of those I jostled aside. The lyrics continued, telling a story I knew—the story of Lanre and Lyra, the love that had destroyed a world. But it wasn't the story I knew. The details were different. The meaning was twisted.

In this version, Lanre was a hero. A man driven to darkness by forces beyond his control, by enemies who had corrupted everything he loved. The cities he destroyed weren't innocent—they were strongholds of evil, bastions of those who had murdered his wife. His transformation into Haliax wasn't a fall from grace, but a sacrifice. A choice to bear eternal torment so that others wouldn't have to.

It was lies. Beautiful, seductive lies.

And everyone in the room was drinking them like water.

*"So mourn not for the shadow-cloaked,*
*Who walks the world in endless night.*
*His burden was the weight of love,*
*His darkness was our saving light."*

The song ended. The silence that followed was complete—not the silence of disappointment, but the silence of awe. Then applause erupted, thunderous and genuine, and Denna smiled her perfect smile and bowed her perfect bow and looked directly at me.

Our eyes met.

Something flickered across her face—surprise, then pleasure, then something harder. Something guarded. She'd known I was back. Of course she'd known. But seeing me here, hearing her song...

She stepped down from the stage, accepting congratulations as she moved through the crowd. People reached out to touch her, as if her talent was something they could catch. She let them, gracious and distant, until she reached me.

"Hello, Kvothe."

"Denna."

We stood there, an arm's length apart, with a year of absence and a lifetime of questions between us. Up close, I could see the changes that distance had hidden. She was thinner. There were shadows under her eyes, cleverly concealed with powder. And her hair—

I looked at her braids more closely. The patterns. The knots.

*Yllish.*

They were Yllish story knots. I'd seen them in the Archives, in books about the old ways of writing. But these weren't the simple preservation patterns I'd studied. These were complex. Layered. And unless I was very much mistaken, they were *active*.

"You've learned something new," I said carefully.

"I've learned many things." Her smile didn't waver. "We should talk. Not here."

We walked along the Omethi River, the water dark and quiet beneath the autumn moon. The crowds of Imre faded behind us, their noise replaced by the whisper of wind through dying leaves.

Denna didn't speak for a long time. Neither did I. We walked as we'd always walked—together and apart, close enough to touch but never touching. The familiar dance of people who were terrified to admit what they felt.

"Your song," I said finally.

"What about it?"

"It's not true."

She stopped walking. In the moonlight, her face was a study in controlled emotion—beautiful and cold, like marble. "And you're an expert on the truth now? You, who've spent a year doing gods-know-what in gods-know-where?"

"I've seen them, Denna. The Chandrian. I've seen what they do."

Something flickered in her eyes. Fear? Recognition? It was gone before I could name it.

"You've seen stories," she said. "Tales told by frightened people about things they don't understand. My patron has shown me the real history. The true history."

"Your patron." I felt my jaw tighten. "Master Ash."

"Is that what you call him?"

"It's what you called him. Before you decided he deserved more respect than a name."

Denna's expression hardened. "Don't."

"Don't what? Don't ask questions? Don't wonder why you're writing songs that make monsters sound like heroes?"

"They weren't monsters!" Her voice rose, sharp and sudden. "That's the whole point! They were people, Kvothe. People who were betrayed. People who were *made* into what they became. The real monsters are the ones who created them. The ones who wrote the history we believe."

"And who told you that? Your patron?"

She didn't answer. She didn't need to.

I reached out, caught her arm—gently, so gently. "Denna. Please. Listen to me. Whoever he is, whatever he's told you, it isn't true. The Chandrian aren't victims. They murdered my family. They murdered my *parents*. I was there. I *saw*—"

"You saw what they wanted you to see." Her voice was quiet now, but no less sharp. "You were a child. A traumatized child. And you've built your entire life around a story you don't understand."

"I understand enough."

"Do you?" She pulled her arm free. "Do you understand why they were there that night? Why they came to your troupe, out of all the places they could have been?"

I stared at her. "They came because—because my father was—"

"Was what? Writing a song?" She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Oh, Kvothe. Your father wasn't the first to write about them. He wasn't even the hundredth. Do you really think they hunt down every minstrel who sings their names?"

"Then why—"

"I don't know." Her voice softened, just a fraction. "But neither do you. That's my point. We're all living in a story, and none of us know who wrote it."

We stood there, the moonlight painting silver lines across the water. I wanted to reach for her. I wanted to shake her, to make her see the truth. I wanted to hold her and never let go.

I looked at her hair again. At the knots that weren't just decoration.

"The patterns in your braids," I said. "They're Yllish."

She went very still.

"I've studied it. A little. Enough to know that what you're wearing isn't just for show." I stepped closer. "What do they say, Denna? What's written in your hair?"

"Nothing that concerns you."

"Everything about you concerns me."

"Does it?" Her eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw something raw there. Something desperate. "Then why weren't you here? Why did you disappear for a year while I—"

She stopped herself. Drew a breath. The mask slid back into place.

"I can't do this," she said. "Not now. Not with you looking at me like I'm the enemy."

"You're not the enemy. But your patron—"

"Leave him out of this."

"I can't. Denna, whatever he's teaching you, whatever he's doing, it's not—" I struggled for words. "The song. The knots. Something is wrong. I can feel it."

"Feeling isn't knowing." She took a step back, putting distance between us. "You've always thought you were so clever, Kvothe. So quick, so brilliant. But some doors don't open to lockpicks and cleverness. Some things can't be understood from the outside."

"Then help me understand from the inside."

"I can't." And for just a moment, her voice cracked. "I want to. God, Kvothe, you have no idea how much I want to. But I can't."

"Why?"

She looked at me for a long moment. The moon had shifted, throwing half her face into shadow. In the darkness, I could almost imagine I saw something else there—something that wasn't quite human looking out through her eyes.

"Because I made a promise," she said. "And some promises aren't meant to be broken."

She walked away.

I let her go.

It was the last time I would see her whole.

"That was where you should have stopped."

The innkeeper's voice was flat. Behind the bar, his hands had gone still on the wood—that same terrible stillness I was learning to recognize.

Chronicler looked up from his papers. "Stopped what?"

"Asking questions. Pushing. Being *clever*." He said the word like a curse. "If I'd just... accepted. If I'd let her have her secrets. Let her walk away without trying to understand."

"You couldn't have known—"

"No." The word was sharp. Final. "I couldn't have known what was coming. But I knew something was wrong. I knew she was in trouble. And instead of helping her, I..." He trailed off, staring at nothing.

Bast moved closer to the bar. "Reshi."

"I pushed," the innkeeper said quietly. "I kept pushing. Because I had to know. Because I thought knowing would save her." He laughed—a hollow, broken sound. "I thought I was the hero of this story. The clever one who figures everything out."

"You were trying to protect her."

"I was trying to be right." He picked up the cloth again, began to wipe the bar with slow, deliberate strokes. "There's a difference. I was too young and too proud to understand it."

"What happened next?" Chronicler asked. His pen was poised, waiting.

The innkeeper was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was softer than before.

"I looked into her patron. I found things I shouldn't have found. And when I confronted her with what I'd learned..." He shook his head. "We fought. Really fought. The way people fight when they love each other and can't say it, so they say everything else instead."

"The next chapter," Chronicler said. "The fight."

"Yes." The innkeeper set down the cloth. "The fight that ended everything. Or started it, depending on how you count."

He looked toward the window, where the grey morning light was slowly brightening. Outside, the world went on—birds singing, wind moving, the ordinary business of a day that didn't know it was anything special.

"I need a drink," he said. "And then I'll tell you how I destroyed the only thing I ever truly loved."
