RENERE WAS A city of masks.

Not literally—though there were plenty of those, given the season. The Midwinter Ball drew nobles from across the Four Corners, and many preferred to hide behind silk and feathers rather than show their true faces. But the masks I noticed were the invisible ones. The smiles that didn't reach the eyes. The conversations that meant something other than what they said.

I'd arrived two days early, at Bredon's suggestion. "Know the terrain before the battle," he'd said. "Learn the exits. Identify the players. Give yourself room to maneuver when everything goes wrong."

When, not if. Even Bredon expected disaster.

The Royal Palace was enormous—a maze of corridors and chambers that had been built, rebuilt, and expanded over centuries. The ballroom where the performance would happen was at its heart, a vast space of crystal chandeliers and marble floors, surrounded by balconies where the truly powerful could watch without being seen.

I walked its perimeter a dozen times. Counted the exits. Noted the shadows where a man might hide. Planned and re-planned and tried not to think about what would happen if I failed.

On the eve of the ball, Denna found me.

---

She was wearing green—the color of spring, of new growth, of hope. Her hair was elaborately styled, the Yllish braids hidden beneath flowers and ribbons. She looked beautiful.

She looked like a woman walking to her execution.

"I knew you'd be here," she said. We were on a balcony overlooking the palace gardens, far from the crowds preparing for tomorrow's festivities. "I could feel you. Like a weight in my chest."

"Denna—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Let me speak. While I still can."

I fell silent.

"I know what's going to happen tomorrow. Not the details—those slip away every time I try to hold them. But I know something terrible is coming. Something I'm going to be part of." Her voice was steady, but her hands trembled. "And I know you're going to try to stop it."

"I have to."

"I know." She smiled, and it was the saddest thing I'd ever seen. "That's who you are, Kvothe. The boy who fights dragons and rescues maidens and never stops to wonder if maybe the maiden doesn't want to be rescued."

"Do you want to be rescued?"

"I don't know what I want anymore." She turned away, looked out at the gardens. "The bindings in my hair... they've been there so long I've forgotten what it felt like to think my own thoughts. Sometimes I wonder if there's even a me left underneath. Or if I'm just the song now, wearing a human face."

"There's you. I can see you. Right now, right here—this is you, Denna. Fighting against the bindings. Trying to warn me."

"Maybe." She didn't sound convinced. "Or maybe this is part of the plan too. Maybe he wanted me to talk to you. To make you hesitate. To give the song the split second it needs to finish."

"Who? Cinder?"

She flinched at the name. "Don't. Don't say it. He might hear. He always hears."

"Then tell me what to do. Tell me how to save you."

She was quiet for a long moment. The night wind stirred her hair, and I caught a glimpse of the braids beneath the flowers—intricate, beautiful, deadly.

"When the song starts," she said finally, "don't listen to the words. Listen to the silence between them. That's where the binding lives. That's where the hook catches."

"And if I can cut the silence—"

"You might break the binding. Or you might just break me." She turned to face me, and her eyes were wet. "I don't know which would be worse. Being free and shattered, or being whole and enslaved."

"Denna—"

"Promise me something." She reached out, took my hands in hers. Her fingers were cold. "If you can't save me—if the binding is too strong—don't let me hurt anyone. Don't let me become the weapon he made me to be."

"I won't let—"

"Promise me, Kvothe." Her grip tightened. "Whatever it takes. Even if it means stopping me. Even if it means..."

She couldn't finish the sentence. But I understood.

"I promise."

We stood there for a long time, holding hands, saying nothing. The night grew cold around us, but neither of us moved to go inside.

"I loved you, you know," she said eventually. "Before all this. When we were just two foolish children playing at being adults. I loved you more than I've ever loved anyone."

"I love you still."

"I know." She pulled her hands away, wrapped her arms around herself. "That's why this is so hard. Because if you didn't love me, you might be able to see clearly. Make the right choice. But love makes us stupid. Makes us hope for impossible things."

"Like what?"

"Like happy endings." She laughed, and it turned into a sob. "Like the hero and the maiden riding off into the sunset. Like stories where love conquers all and nobody has to die."

"Maybe—"

"This isn't that kind of story." She stepped back, put distance between us. "This is the other kind. The kind where the maiden is the dragon, and the hero has to choose between saving the world and saving his heart."

She was crying now, openly, and I wanted nothing more than to hold her. To tell her it would be alright. To promise that I would find a way to save both her and the world.

But I'd already made one promise tonight. And I didn't know if I could keep it.

"Goodbye, Kvothe." She turned to leave. "Whatever happens tomorrow—remember that I'm sorry. Remember that I didn't want any of this."

"Denna—"

"And remember that the girl who loved you was real. Even if she was never as free as she pretended to be."

She walked away. Into the palace. Into the night.

Into the morning that would destroy everything.

"That was the last time you spoke to her," Chronicler said. "Before the ball."

"The last time I spoke to her ever." The innkeeper's voice was barely audible. "By the time the song ended, she couldn't speak anymore. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't..."

He trailed off.

"She warned you. Tried to help you stop it."

"She did what she could. Even bound, even controlled, she found a way to resist. To give me a chance." He picked up a glass, stared at the amber liquid inside. "That's what I try to remember. Not the way she fell. Not the look on her face when the silence took her. But that moment on the balcony, when she was still herself. Still fighting."

"Did it help? What she told you about the silence between the words?"

"It might have. If I'd been faster. If I'd understood sooner. If I'd been able to cut the binding without cutting her." He drank, set the glass down hard. "But I wasn't. And she died knowing that the man she loved was the one who killed her."

"She knew you were trying to save her."

"Did she? In that last moment, when the silence took her voice—did she understand what I was doing? Or did she just see me standing there, speaking the word that ended her life?"

He looked up, and his eyes were ancient.

"I'll never know. That's the cruelest part. I'll spend the rest of my life wondering if she died thinking I betrayed her."

"You didn't."

"Didn't I?" He laughed, bitter and broken. "I promised to stop her. I made that choice before I even entered the ballroom. Before I understood what it would cost." He shook his head. "She asked me to do it. But that doesn't make it any less of a betrayal."

"It makes it a sacrifice. Hers."

The innkeeper considered that for a long moment.

"Maybe," he said finally. "Maybe that's one way to tell the story. The maiden who chose to die rather than become the dragon. The hero who honored her choice, even when it destroyed him."

"Is that the true version?"

"There's no true version." He picked up his eternal cloth, began to wipe the bar. "There's just the version we tell ourselves so we can keep living. And the silence where the truth used to be."
