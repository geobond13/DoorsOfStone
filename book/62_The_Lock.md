BAST FOUND ME in the third year.

By then, I had settled into the rhythm of the Waystone like water settling into a vessel. Wake before dawn. Light the fires. Begin the bread. Wait for the few customers who might wander in—farmers seeking breakfast, travelers passing through, the occasional merchant who'd taken a wrong turn somewhere and found himself in a town that existed on no reliable map.

I had become Kote.

Not dramatically, not consciously. Just gradually, one small surrender at a time. I stopped reaching for powers I no longer had. Stopped wincing at the name that wasn't quite my name. Stopped looking in mirrors and being surprised by the red hair that seemed too vivid for the grey life I was living.

The silence helped.

It had become my constant companion—not the hungry void I had spoken in Renere, but something gentler. A presence that cushioned me from the world, that muted the edges of experience, that made everything feel slightly distant. I moved through my days as if walking through deep water, each action requiring more effort than it should have, each sensation arriving slightly delayed.

I had come to think of it as a blessing.

Others might have called it a curse. But curses and blessings are often just different names for the same thing, depending on your perspective.

He appeared one morning without warning.

I was behind the bar, wiping glasses that didn't need wiping, when the door opened and a young man walked in. He had sharp features and sharper eyes, dark hair that fell in calculated waves, and a smile that seemed to know more than it should.

"Interesting place," he said, looking around the common room. "Very ordinary. Remarkably ordinary, in fact. The kind of ordinary that takes effort to achieve."

"Can I help you?"

"Oh, I hope so." He settled onto a barstool with the easy grace of someone who was comfortable in any environment. "I've been looking for you for quite some time. You're surprisingly difficult to find, considering how famous you used to be."

The word hit me like a blow. Famous. As if fame still mattered. As if the stories they told about me had any connection to who I'd become.

"I think you have me confused with someone else."

"I don't think I do." His smile widened. "Red hair, green eyes, hands that used to play music that could bring the dead to weeping. You're Kvothe. Or you were, before you became... this."

"My name is Kote."

"Your name is whatever you choose to call yourself. That doesn't change what you are." He leaned forward. "I'm Bast. And I've come a very long way to find you."

---

He wasn't human.

I knew it immediately—had known it from the moment he walked through the door, though I'd tried to pretend otherwise. The Fae carry a particular otherness that no amount of glamour can fully disguise. It's in the way they move, the way light falls around them, the way the air seems slightly uncertain about their presence.

"You're from the Fae realm," I said.

"I am."

"Why are you looking for me?"

"Because you're the only person who might understand what I'm carrying." His eyes were ancient despite his young face—older than the mountains, older than the sea, filled with the accumulated weight of centuries. "And because the Fae realm is dying. Slowly, but surely. Ever since the doors were sealed."

"The seal is necessary."

"I know. That doesn't make it less painful." He traced a finger along the bar's surface. "When you closed those doors, you cut off something vital. Not just passages between worlds—but the flow of something essential. Stories, maybe. Or dreams. Or whatever substance reality is made of when you strip away all the lies."

"I didn't close the doors. I strengthened the seals that were already failing."

"Same difference, from my perspective." His voice was gentle, not accusatory. "I'm not blaming you. The alternative was worse—the things that wanted to come through, the transformation they would have caused. But the fact remains that my world is slowly suffocating. And I want to understand why."

"Understanding won't help you."

"Understanding always helps. Even when it can't fix anything, it makes the pain more bearable." He met my eyes. "You know that better than anyone. That's why you spend your nights staring at a chest you'll never open."

I went very still.

"Oh yes," he said softly. "I can see it. Feel it, really. The silence that surrounds you, the weight you're carrying—it's concentrated in that room upstairs. Something locked away. Something that used to be part of you."

"You should leave."

"I don't think I should." He didn't move. "I think I should stay. Learn what you can teach me. Try to understand the forces that are reshaping my world."

"I can't teach you anything. I'm not what I used to be."

"No. You're something else now. Something that's learned to live with silence, to carry loss, to continue existing when existence seems pointless." His smile was sad. "Those are exactly the lessons I need."

---

He stayed.

Against my better judgment, against every instinct that screamed I should send him away, I let him stay. Perhaps because I was lonely—though I would never have admitted it. Perhaps because he reminded me of something I'd lost, some connection to a wider world that the Waystone had cut me off from.

Or perhaps because he was right.

He needed to learn how to live with dying. And I, who had been dying slowly for three years, was the only teacher he could find.

He cleaned rooms. He helped with meals. He listened to stories from the few travelers who passed through, cataloguing them with an archivist's precision, as if every tale might contain a clue to the mystery he was trying to solve.

And gradually, carefully, he began to ask about the chest.

---

"It's made of roah wood," he observed, one evening after the inn had closed. "The same material as the Lackless box. Rare. Expensive. Almost impossible to work, unless you know the proper techniques."

"I know the proper techniques."

"Obviously. But the locks—" He studied the chest from across the room, not approaching it, respecting the boundary I'd established. "They're unusual. Not mechanical. Something else. Something that responds to naming, I think, though I can't quite identify the nature of the binding."

"They respond to silence."

"The silence you carry?"

"The silence I've become." I wiped the bar, not looking at him. "When I unmade Cinder, something changed. The power I used—the combination of naming and silence—it burned out my abilities. But it also created... echoes. Fragments of what I used to be, too powerful to fade but too damaged to control."

"And you locked them away."

"I gave them somewhere to be. Somewhere they couldn't hurt anyone." I finally met his eyes. "Including me."

"What's inside?"

"Things I used to be."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer you're getting."

He was quiet for a long moment.

"The Fae tell stories about you," he said finally. "About the man who broke Cinder. Who sealed the doors. Who gave up everything to save a world that doesn't even know what he did."

"Stories lie."

"Stories are all we have. They're how we make sense of things that don't make sense. How we give meaning to suffering that has no meaning." He looked at the chest. "The story of that chest is important, Reshi. Even if you won't tell it to me."

"Reshi?"

"A term of respect. In my language, it means something like 'teacher.'" He smiled slightly. "You haven't agreed to teach me anything. But I'm learning anyway."

---

Months passed.

Bast became part of my life the way furniture becomes part of a room—present, familiar, eventually unremarkable. He had an endless capacity for stillness, for waiting, for observing without demanding. And slowly, in the spaces between silences, I began to talk.

Not about the chest. Not about what I'd lost. But about other things—philosophy, magic, the nature of names and the way reality responds to belief. The theoretical knowledge that had survived even when my practical abilities had burned away.

He absorbed everything with a hunger that would have been alarming if I hadn't understood its source. His world was dying. The knowledge I carried might be the only thing that could save it—or at least explain why it couldn't be saved.

"The seals were never meant to be permanent," I told him, one night when the winter wind was howling outside and we'd finished a bottle of wine that I shouldn't have opened. "They were designed to weaken over time. To allow a gradual healing rather than a sudden change."

"But you reinforced them."

"I had to. Cinder was using the weakening as an opportunity. If I'd let the process continue naturally, he would have channeled the energy into his transformation. Become something..." I shook my head. "Something that couldn't be stopped. Something that would have reshaped reality according to his will."

"So you closed the doors completely. Permanently."

"Not permanently. Nothing is permanent. But... differently than they were meant to close." I stared into the fire. "I don't know what I did, exactly. The silence spoke through me—or I spoke through it—and when it was over, the doors were sealed in ways I don't fully understand."

"And your world was saved."

"My world was saved. Yours was damaged." I looked at him. "I'm sorry. That's not something I can fix."

"I know." His eyes were ancient, accepting. "But knowing helps. Understanding why we're dying is better than dying in confusion."

---

The chest came up again in the second year of his stay.

I had been having nightmares—more frequently, more vividly, more impossible to shake off after waking. Dreams of Denna singing songs that unraveled reality. Dreams of King Roderic falling, his hand on his heart, his eyes full of confusion. Dreams of silence, spreading like blood across a ballroom floor, stopping the breath of everyone it touched.

Bast found me one morning sitting in front of the chest, my hands trembling, my face wet with tears I didn't remember crying.

"The locks," he said quietly. "They're resonating. Responding to something inside you."

"To the nightmares."

"To the memories, I think. The things you've locked away aren't just power—they're also pain. Trauma. The experiences you couldn't process while you were surviving them." He sat beside me. "They're trying to get out."

"They can't get out."

"Maybe they shouldn't stay in." He hesitated. "Reshi... what if the locks aren't protecting you? What if they're just delaying something inevitable?"

"They're protecting everyone. The powers inside—they're broken. Changed by what happened. If I released them now, they wouldn't work the way they used to. They'd destroy instead of create."

"How do you know?"

"Because I designed the locks to respond to my current state. Not my memories of who I was—my actual condition, right now." I touched the roah wood, felt the silence humming beneath its surface. "The locks can only open when I'm ready. When I've healed enough to control what's inside. And I don't know if that will ever happen."

"What if someone else opened them?"

"They can't. The locks are tied to the name of silence, and the silence is tied to me." I met his eyes. "That's the design. That's the safeguard. No one can open this chest except me—and I'm not capable of opening it right now."

"Not capable, or not willing?"

The question hung in the air.

"Both," I admitted. "Both."

---

He asked about the woman, eventually.

"Denna," I said, and the word felt strange in my mouth. A name I rarely spoke anymore. A name that still carried weight, even now. "She was... she is... part of the binding. Part of the seal itself."

"You loved her."

"I love her. Present tense. Love doesn't stop just because the person is gone."

"She's not gone. You talk to her sometimes—I've heard you, late at night, speaking to someone who isn't there."

"She's not here. But she's not gone either." I struggled to explain. "The seal needed something to anchor it. Someone to serve as a living lock, the way the Chandrian once did. When I reinforced the doors, I used... I used our connection. The bond between us. I wove her into the seal itself."

"She's immortal now?"

"She's eternal. There's a difference." I closed my eyes. "She's everywhere and nowhere. Part of the binding that holds reality together. Sometimes, when the silence is quiet and the world is still, I can feel her. Hear her voice, faint as distant bells."

"Does it hurt?"

"Not the way I expected. It's more like..." I searched for words. "Like having someone you love in the next room. You can't see them. You can't touch them. But you know they're there. You can feel their presence, their existence, their continued being."

"And you can never reach them."

"No. Never." I opened my eyes. "That's the price I paid. Not just my powers, not just my abilities—but any hope of being with her again. She's part of the seal now. And I'm just a man running an inn in a town that barely exists."

Bast was quiet for a long time.

"The Fae have a word for that kind of love," he said finally. "The kind that transcends death, transcends separation, transcends everything that should make it impossible. We call it *mael*. It means 'the wound that heals by never closing.'"

"That's very poetic."

"We're a poetic people." He smiled slightly. "And we know something about wounds that never close."

---

Years passed.

The inn continued. The silence continued. The slow, steady rhythm of existence continued, each day indistinguishable from the last, each night a small eternity of waiting.

Bast learned. I taught, in my own way, though I never thought of myself as a teacher. We developed a friendship of sorts—the kind that exists between two people who understand each other's brokenness without needing to discuss it.

And the chest sat in the corner of my room, humming quietly, waiting.

Three locks.

Three conditions that might—someday—be met.

Three doors between me and everything I'd lost.

Denna reached for me sometimes. Not often—the binding spread her too thin for frequent contact. But occasionally, in the quiet hours before dawn, I would feel her presence. Her voice, barely audible, saying things that didn't quite form words.

*Still here,* she would whisper. *Still holding.*

*I know,* I would answer. *I'm holding too.*

And we would be silent together, connected across the vast distance between what is and what was.

Two pieces of the same broken thing.

Still fitting.

Still holding.
