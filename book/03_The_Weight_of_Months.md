ADMISSIONS WAS BRUTAL.

I'd expected that. The Arcanum has never been kind to students who disappear. But I hadn't expected Hemme's smile.

It was the smile of a man who had been sharpening something for months. Who had practiced this moment in mirrors.

"Eight months," he said, flipping through papers with theatrical slowness. "Eight months absent. No word. No correspondence. And now you simply... walk back in and expect to resume your studies?"

"I was on sanctioned leave, Master Hemme. Arranged before my departure."

"Yes, for *three months*. Not eight." He set the papers down. "The additional time is unaccounted for. Unexplained. One might wonder what a young man could possibly be doing for five months that he couldn't be bothered to send word."

The other masters watched me with varying degrees of interest. Kilvin's eyes were neutral but attentive. Lorren's face was its usual stone mask. Elodin sat at the end of the table, apparently fascinated by something he'd found beneath his fingernail.

"I was delayed by circumstances beyond my control," I said carefully. "The nature of those circumstances is difficult to explain."

"Try."

I considered my options. The truth—that I'd spent weeks in the Fae, that time had moved differently there, that I'd bedded Felurian and spoken with the Cthaeh—would sound like madness or lies. But evasion would only feed Hemme's suspicions.

"I traveled through places where time moves differently than it does here," I said finally. "What felt like weeks to me was months in the mortal world. I returned as quickly as I could."

Hemme's laugh was sharp and ugly. "Places where time moves differently. How convenient. I suppose next you'll claim you were in the Fae, dancing with spirits and dining on moonlight."

I said nothing.

The silence stretched.

Elodin looked up from his fingernails. "He's telling the truth."

Every eye in the room turned to him. Even Hemme seemed taken aback.

"Excuse me?"

"I said he's telling the truth." Elodin waved a hand vaguely. "Look at him. Really look. He's got the residue all over him. The Fae leaves marks, if you know what to look for."

"This is ridiculous—"

"Master Hemme." Lorren's voice was quiet, but it cut through Hemme's bluster like a knife through silk. "Is there a specific academic concern you wish to raise regarding Re'lar Kvothe's status, or are we merely engaging in speculation?"

Hemme's face reddened. "I simply think the Arcanum should maintain standards. We cannot allow students to vanish for months at a time and return without consequence—"

"The consequence," Kilvin interrupted, "is that Re'lar Kvothe will be required to demonstrate his continued competence in all relevant disciplines. If he has fallen behind, he will be reduced in rank. If he has maintained his skills, he will continue his studies." The Artificer's accent thickened slightly. "This is the standard procedure. There is no need to invent new torments."

The vote was five to two. I was readmitted with a tuition of twelve talents and six jots—painful, but not impossible. Hemme and Brandeur voted against; Hemme because he hated me, Brandeur because he always followed Hemme's lead.

As I left the Masters' Hall, Elodin fell into step beside me.

"You really were there," he said. "The Fae. How long?"

"I'm not sure. A few weeks, maybe. It felt like longer."

"It always does." He stopped walking, turned to face me with an expression I'd never seen on him before. Something between concern and... was that fear? "Did you speak with anything? In the Fae. Anything with more than animal intelligence?"

I thought of the Cthaeh. Of its knowing eyes and poison tongue.

"Yes."

"What?"

"A tree."

Elodin went very still. For a long moment, he didn't speak. Then, quietly: "The Rhinna tree."

"Yes."

"The Cthaeh."

"Yes."

He closed his eyes. When he opened them again, the fear was still there, but it had hardened into something like resignation.

"Come to my rooms tonight. After dinner. We need to talk about what happens next."

I found Auri on the rooftops.

She was where she always was—or rather, she was where I always seemed to find her, which may or may not have been the same thing. The moon was a slender crescent above us, and her pale hair caught its light like spun silver.

"You came back," she said, not turning around. "I knew you would. The moon told me, three nights ago. She said, 'He's walking home now. He's almost here.'"

I sat beside her on the tiles, careful not to disturb whatever internal geography had placed her there. "Did she tell you anything else?"

"She said you were different. Heavier. That you'd been carrying things you shouldn't have picked up." Auri finally looked at me, and her eyes were very bright. "She was right. I can see them. The weights."

"What do they look like?"

"Shadows. But not dark shadows—the other kind. The kind that pulls the light into them and makes it different colors." She reached out, almost touched my chest, then drew her hand back. "There's something sleeping here. Something cold."

"The name of silence," I said. The words came out before I could stop them.

Auri's face went very still. For a moment, she wasn't the strange, broken girl I'd befriended. She was something older. Something that remembered things most people had forgotten.

"That's a dangerous thing to know," she said softly. "Dangerous to say. Dangerous to have."

"I didn't choose it."

"Names don't ask to be chosen. They find the people they fit." She stood, brushed off her ragged dress. "Come. I have something for you. Something I've been saving."

I followed her down into the Underthing, through passages I'd walked before and some I hadn't. The darkness didn't bother me anymore—another change from Ademre, where I'd learned to move through shadow like water.

She led me to a room I didn't recognize. Small, circular, lined with shelves that held objects I couldn't identify. Broken things, mostly. Things that had been beautiful once.

"Here." She pressed something into my hand. Cold. Hard. A key, carved from bone.

"What is this?"

"For later." Her eyes met mine, and there was something in them that made my skin prickle. "For when all the other doors are closed. For when you need to open something that doesn't want to open."

"Auri, I don't understand—"

"You will." She smiled, and for just a moment, she was simply Auri again—sweet and strange and impossibly wise. "The broken things always understand, eventually. That's what being broken teaches you. How to see the cracks where the light gets in."

I looked at the key in my hand. Felt its weight, its wrongness, its promise of doors not yet imagined.

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." She was already turning away, disappearing into the shadows of her underground kingdom. "Thank me when you use it. Thank me when it works."

Her voice echoed back from the darkness: "Or don't thank me at all. That's probably safer."

That night, in Elodin's rooms, I learned the shape of my doom.

He didn't offer me wine or pleasantries. He simply sat across from me in his cluttered chambers and said, "Tell me exactly what the Cthaeh told you. Every word you can remember."

I told him.

When I finished, his face was ashen.

"The Sithe hunt anyone who speaks with the Cthaeh," he said. "They kill them. Without exception. Because every word that thing speaks is designed to cause the maximum possible harm."

"Then why haven't they found me?"

"I don't know. Maybe they don't know yet. Maybe they're waiting for something." He stood, began to pace. "Or maybe the Cthaeh already accounted for them. Every action you take, every choice you make—it's already seen it. Already incorporated it into its design."

"What am I supposed to do?"

"I don't know that either." He stopped pacing, turned to face me. "But I know this: everything you think you know about the Chandrian, about Denna, about your parents' death—the Cthaeh gave you just enough truth to make you act. And when you act, you're doing exactly what it wants."

"So I should do nothing?"

"No." His voice was heavy. "That's the trap. Inaction is also action. The Cthaeh chose its words knowing that you'd either act on them or choose not to. Either way, you're playing its game."

I felt cold. Not winter-cold. Understanding-cold. The chill of knowing you are a piece on a board you cannot see.

"Then what's the point?" The words came out bitter. "If I'm going to destroy everything no matter what I do, why bother trying to save anything?"

Elodin was quiet for a long moment.

"Because that's what we are," he said finally. "We know we'll die. We know it won't matter. And we try anyway." He shrugged. "The Cthaeh is ancient. It sees everything. But it doesn't understand why someone would fight a battle they've already lost."

He put his hand on my shoulder.

"It doesn't understand hope. That's its blind spot. Maybe its only one."

"And if I destroy everything?"

"Then you'll have done it trying to save the people you love." His eyes were very bright. "That's not nothing, Kvothe. That's not nothing at all."

I left his rooms with more questions than answers.

But beneath the fear, beneath the weight of everything, something else stirred.

Not hope. Not yet.

Defiance.

I was marked. Doomed. A disaster walking.

But the Cthaeh wasn't the only one who could play a long game. And I had something it didn't.

I had nothing left to lose.
