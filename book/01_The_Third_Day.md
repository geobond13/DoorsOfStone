MORNING CAME SLOWLY to the Waystone Inn, grey light seeping through the windows like water through a cracked hull. The fire had died sometime in the night, leaving the common room cold and cheerless. Somewhere outside, a bird began to sing—tentative, uncertain, as if testing whether the world was still a place where such things were permitted.

Chronicler was already awake. He sat at the same corner table, his papers spread before him in careful stacks. Two days of story, organized and labeled. His eyes were red-rimmed from lack of sleep, but his hands were steady as he checked his ink, tested his pens. Prepared for the final act.

Bast had not slept at all. He stood by the front door, one hand resting on the wood as if he could feel what waited on the other side. His face was pale in the grey morning light, and when he turned to look at Chronicler, there was something hollow in his expression. Something that looked almost like grief.

"He hasn't come down," Bast said. It wasn't a question.

Chronicler shook his head. "I heard him moving around. An hour ago, maybe. Then nothing."

Bast's jaw tightened. He looked up at the ceiling, toward the room where the innkeeper slept—or didn't sleep. Toward the thrice-locked chest that sat at the foot of a bed, patient as a grave.

"He'll come," Chronicler said, though he didn't sound certain. "He said he'd finish the story."

"He says a lot of things." Bast pushed away from the door and crossed to the bar, moving behind it with the easy familiarity of someone who'd done it a thousand times. He began to prepare breakfast—eggs, bread, thick slices of bacon that sizzled in the pan. The sounds and smells of ordinary life, desperately normal against the weight of what pressed in from outside.

They ate in silence. Chronicler watched the stairs. Bast watched the windows.

The bird outside had stopped singing.

---

He came down just before midmorning.

The innkeeper descended the stairs with careful, measured steps—the walk of an old man, though his face showed no age. He'd dressed simply, as always: white shirt, dark trousers, the apron of his trade. His red hair was tied back, and his eyes...

Chronicler looked away from those eyes. There was something in them today that hadn't been there before. A stillness that went deeper than resignation. An emptiness that felt almost like peace.

"Good morning," the innkeeper said. His voice was quiet, but it carried.

Bast set down a plate of food. "You need to eat, Reshi."

The innkeeper—Kote—looked at the plate for a long moment. Then he picked up a piece of bread, tore off a corner, chewed mechanically. It might have been sawdust for all the attention he paid it.

"The soldiers came through again last night," Bast said. "After you went upstairs. A whole company this time. The Penitent King's men."

"I know."

"They're conscripting. Anyone of fighting age. The smith's boy, the chandler's apprentice—"

"I know."

Bast's hands curled into fists on the bar. "They're looking for you, Reshi. Maybe not specifically, but... they're looking for something. Someone. There are stories spreading. About a red-haired man who broke the world."

The innkeeper's expression didn't change. "There are always stories."

"These ones are getting closer to the truth."

For a long moment, nobody spoke. The silence stretched, fragile as spun glass.

Then the innkeeper set down his bread. He looked at Chronicler, at the waiting papers, at the pen poised and ready. Something shifted in his face—a resolve, perhaps. Or a surrender.

"The third day," he said. "That's what you're waiting for."

Chronicler nodded. "If you're willing."

"Willing." The word seemed to amuse him, though his face didn't smile. "I've told you about my parents. About Tarbean. About the University and Ambrose and the Fishery. I've told you about Denna."

He paused on her name, just for a moment. A crack in the mask.

"I've told you about the road to Vintas. About the Maer and his court. About the bandits in the Eld and the Adem and their swords. About Felurian." Another pause. "I've told you everything that made me who I was."

"But not who you became," Chronicler said quietly. "Not how Kvothe became Kote."

The innkeeper's jaw tightened. For a moment he looked almost angry—a flash of something vital beneath the stillness. Then it faded, and he was just a tired man standing behind a bar in the middle of nowhere.

"No," he said. "Not that. Not yet." He picked up a cloth, began to wipe down the already-clean bar. An old habit. A way to keep his hands busy while his mind worked.

"There are two ways to tell the end of a story," he said. "The way you wanted it to happen. And the way it actually did."

"You've said that before," Bast murmured.

"Because it's true." The innkeeper set down the cloth. His hands were very still. "I've been telling you the story I wanted. The one where I was clever, where I solved the puzzles, where I was the hero of my own tale." He looked up, and his eyes met Chronicler's. "Today I tell you what actually happened. What I actually did."

Chronicler dipped his pen. "I'm ready."

The innkeeper—Kvothe—took a deep breath. And when he spoke again, his voice had changed. It was still quiet, still tired. But beneath it was something else. An echo of the young man he'd once been. The one who had burned so bright.

"I came back from Ademre in the dying days of autumn," he said. "The leaves were falling, and the wind had teeth. I'd been gone longer than I meant to be—time moves strangely in the Fae, and the weeks I spent with Felurian had cost me months in the mortal world..."

---

*I came back from Ademre in the dying days of autumn.*

*The road through the mountains was cold and empty. I walked alone, which was unusual for me. I'd grown accustomed to company—to Tempi's silent presence on the journey there, to the strange sisterhood of the Adem on the way back. But I'd left them at the border of their lands, and now it was just me and the wind and the sword at my hip.*

*Caesura. The poet-killer. I still wasn't sure if the name was a blessing or a curse.*

*I should have been eager to return. The University waited. My friends waited. Denna—*

*But I wasn't eager. Something in me had changed during my time away. The months with the Maer had taught me politics. The weeks in the Eld had taught me violence. The time in Ademre had taught me... what? Stillness, perhaps. The Lethani. A way of moving through the world without being moved by it.*

*And Felurian.*

*I didn't think about Felurian. Not because I wanted to forget her, but because thinking of her was like staring at the sun. Too bright. Too much. She had shown me things about myself that I wasn't ready to understand.*

*So I walked, and I didn't think, and the mountains gave way to foothills and the foothills to farmland and the farmland to the sprawling mess of civilization that clustered around the University like mushrooms around a fallen log.*

*It was strange, coming back. The road was familiar—I'd walked it a dozen times before. But I saw it differently now. The inns where I'd played for my supper looked smaller. The merchants on the road seemed slower, more complacent. I passed a troupe of Edema Ruh, and they called out to me, inviting me to share their fire, and I...*

*I almost didn't stop. Almost kept walking. Because stopping meant talking, and talking meant being Kvothe again, and I wasn't sure I remembered how.*

*But I stopped. Of course I stopped. They were my people, even if I'd spent years pretending otherwise. I shared their fire and their food and their wine, and I played for them—old songs, traveling songs, the music that lived in Edema bones—and for a few hours I remembered what it felt like to belong somewhere.*

*In the morning, I left before dawn. I didn't say goodbye. It was easier that way.*

*The University appeared on the horizon three days later. The familiar towers, the sprawling buildings, the Archives rising above it all like a monument to everything humanity had ever thought worth knowing. My home. Or the closest thing I had to one.*

*I should have felt relieved. I should have felt excited.*

*I felt nothing at all.*

---

*Admissions was brutal.*

*I expected that. I'd been gone for the better part of a year, and the Masters had long memories. Hemme was there, of course, wearing his smug smile like a shield. Brandeur looked bored. Kilvin's eyes held something that might have been disappointment, or might have been concern.*

*Lorren was the one who worried me.*

*He sat at the end of the table, still as stone, watching me with eyes that gave nothing away. He hadn't changed—he never seemed to change—but something in the way he looked at me was different. More... focused. As if he was seeing something that hadn't been there before.*

*They asked me about my time away. Where had I gone? What had I learned? I told them what I could—the Maer's court, the bandit hunt, my studies in Ademre. I left out Felurian. I left out the Cthaeh. Some things you don't share with men who can raise your tuition on a whim.*

*"Quite an adventure," Hemme said, his voice dripping with false amusement. "Bandits. Foreign sword-fighters. And yet you return with no scholarly work to show for it. No thesis. No research. Just... stories."*

*"With respect, Master Hemme, the Adem Ketan is not a story. It's a martial discipline that—"*

*"A discipline you could not possibly have mastered in the time you were there."*

*I bit back my first response. And my second. The Lethani, I reminded myself. The right action in the right moment. Hemme was not worth the anger he provoked.*

*"I don't claim mastery," I said evenly. "Only study."*

*The Masters deliberated. I stood and waited, my face carefully blank. This was familiar, at least. The eternal struggle for tuition. The game I'd been playing since my first term, when I'd arrived with nothing but talent and desperation.*

*"Twelve talents," Chancellor Herma announced. "Welcome back, Re'lar Kvothe."*

*Twelve talents. It could have been worse. It could have been much worse. But it was still more than I had, which meant I'd be visiting Devi before the day was out.*

*Devi. Another conversation I wasn't looking forward to.*

*I collected my papers and turned to leave. And that's when Lorren spoke.*

*"A moment, Re'lar Kvothe."*

*The other Masters were already filing out, already moving on to the next student, the next problem. But Lorren remained seated, watching me with those unreadable eyes.*

*"Master Lorren?"*

*"You've been to the Maer's court," he said. It wasn't a question. "You've seen the Lackless family."*

*My chest tightened. How did he know about—*

*"I keep informed," Lorren said, as if reading my thoughts. "Lady Lackless has... certain connections to matters I follow closely." He rose from his seat, smoothing his robes with precise, deliberate motions. "Walk with me, Re'lar."*

*It was not a request.*

*We left the admissions hall together, Lorren's long strides forcing me to hurry to keep pace. He said nothing as we walked, leading me through the winding paths between buildings, past students who nodded respectfully and gave us wide berth.*

*He didn't speak until we reached the Archives. Until we stood before those massive doors, carved with symbols I'd never been able to read.*

*"You've been asking questions," Lorren said quietly. "About the Amyr. About the Chandrian. About things that are better left buried."*

*"I've asked questions about many things. I'm a student. That's what we do."*

*"Indeed." He looked at me—really looked, in a way that made me feel like a book he was evaluating for purchase. "And students who ask the wrong questions sometimes find answers they're not prepared for."*

*"Is that a warning, Master Lorren?"*

*"It's an observation." He turned back to the Archives, to the doors that led to all the knowledge in the world—and all the secrets buried within it. "There are... gaps in the collection. Intentional gaps. Books that have been removed. Records that have been altered."*

*I stared at him. This was the last thing I expected. Lorren, of all people, admitting that the Archives were incomplete?*

*"Why are you telling me this?"*

*"Because you're going to find out anyway. You're not stupid, Re'lar, whatever else you might be. And I'd rather you hear it from me than from..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "From someone who might not have your best interests at heart."*

*"Someone like who?"*

*But Lorren was already walking away, his dark robes swirling behind him like a scholar's shadow.*

*"Be careful, Re'lar Kvothe," he called back. "There are doors in this world that open only one way. And some of them lead to places you cannot return from."*

*I stood there for a long moment, watching him go. The autumn wind cut through my clothes, and the leaves scraped against the stones like whispered warnings.*

*I should have listened.*

*I never listen.*

The innkeeper stopped.

Chronicler's pen hovered over the page. Bast had gone still by the window, his eyes fixed on something only he could see.

"That was my first day back," the innkeeper said. His voice was quiet again, drained of the energy that had briefly animated it. "My first hour, really. And already the threads were beginning to tangle."

"Lorren warned you," Chronicler said. "That's... unexpected."

"Not a warning. An observation." The innkeeper smiled, but there was no humor in it. "That's what he said, anyway. It took me years to understand the difference."

"What difference?"

"A warning tells you to stop. An observation tells you that someone is watching." The innkeeper picked up his cloth again, began to wipe down the bar in slow, circular motions. "Lorren was Amyr. I know that now. And the Amyr were watching me from the very beginning."

Bast made a sound—something between a laugh and a sob. "Reshi..."

"Not yet, Bast. We're not there yet." The innkeeper looked at Chronicler, at the waiting pen, at the story that still had so far to go. "I need to tell you about Denna. About her song. About what she'd become while I was away."

He took a breath. Let it out slowly.

"I need to tell you about the fight that ended everything. And how I was too clever to see what was right in front of me."

Outside, the morning light had turned grey again. Clouds gathering on the horizon. A storm coming, perhaps.

Or something worse.
