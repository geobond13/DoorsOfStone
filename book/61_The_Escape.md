AURI KNEW PATHS I'd never imagined.

Not through the Underthing—these were something else entirely. Doors between places. Thin spots in reality where, if you knew how, you could step from one location to another instantly. The kind of paths that shouldn't exist in a world that followed logical rules.

But logic had never been Auri's primary concern.

"The binding wasn't just prison," she explained, as we walked through a forest that shouldn't exist.

The trees here were silver-barked and strange, their leaves a pale luminescence that cast no shadows. The air tasted of something I couldn't name—not quite honey, not quite rain, but something in between. Our footsteps made no sound on the forest floor, though the ground seemed solid enough beneath our feet.

"Cinder's patterns taught me things about the world's structure. About how places connect."

"He bound you to teach you?"

"He bound me to use me. The teaching was incidental." She ducked under a branch that appeared to be made of crystallized moonlight—or perhaps actual moonlight, captured and frozen in a moment of falling. "But knowledge is knowledge. I kept what I learned even after the binding broke."

I followed her, still reeling from what had happened in the mountain.

The unmaking of Cinder. The collapse of the sanctuary. The moment when the name of silence had poured through me and erased three thousand years of existence in a single breath.

I should have felt victorious. Should have felt something—relief, triumph, satisfaction that the thing which had killed my parents was finally, truly gone.

Instead, I felt empty.

The silence inside me had grown vast in that final moment, had expanded to fill spaces I didn't know I had. And now that the battle was over, now that there was nothing left to fight, it settled into those spaces with the patience of water finding its level.

"Where are we going?" I asked, my voice strange in the soundless forest.

"Somewhere safe. Somewhere they won't think to look for you."

"Who?"

"Everyone." She glanced back at me, and her eyes held that particular combination of wisdom and otherworldliness that had always made her seem more Fae than human. "Meluan's hunters are searching the Four Corners. The University has issued statements distancing themselves from you. And there are others—followers of Cinder, people who believed in what he was trying to do—who want revenge."

"I'm a wanted man."

"You're a dead man, according to the rumors. Some say you died in the explosion at Renere. Some say you were consumed by the magic you tried to control. Others claim you fled to the Fae realm and will never return." She smiled faintly, the expression almost playful. "Let's keep it that way. Dead men don't have to run."

---

We traveled for weeks through impossible places.

Forests where the trees grew upside down, their roots reaching toward a sky that was somehow beneath us. Valleys filled with mist that whispered in languages I didn't recognize—old languages, I thought, languages that had been spoken before humans learned to speak at all. Cities abandoned so long ago that even their ruins had crumbled to dust, and we walked through the ghosts of streets that had once held thousands.

"These are the between-places," Auri explained, on what might have been our third day of travel. "The spaces that exist in the cracks of reality. The binding sealed most of them, but some remain—small pockets, forgotten corners."

"I didn't know such places existed."

"Most people don't. The binding was meant to separate the world from everything else—from the Fae, from the Shapers' realm, from all the spaces that existed before existence was divided." She paused at a place where the path split into three directions, each one leading somewhere that shouldn't have been possible. "But you can't seal everything. There are always cracks. Always spaces between the spaces."

"Is this where you'll hide me?"

"No. These places are too unstable. You need somewhere more permanent." She chose the middle path, walking forward with the certainty of someone who had traveled this way many times before. "There's a village. Small. Remote. The kind of place where strangers are rare but not unwelcome."

"A village."

"A chance to be someone else. To build a life that isn't defined by what you were." She touched my arm—a rare gesture from her, who usually avoided physical contact. "The world thinks Kvothe is dead, or worse. Let them think it. Become someone new."

"Someone who can't play music. Can't name the wind. Can't do any of the things that made him who he was."

"Someone who's still alive. Someone who can learn new things." Her eyes were gentle, but there was steel beneath the gentleness. "The old Auri would have died in Cinder's binding. The new Auri survived it. Changed, yes. Diminished in some ways. But still here. Still herself."

"How do you do it? Accept the change?"

She was quiet for a long moment.

We walked through a field of flowers that glowed with their own light, each blossom a different color, their petals chiming softly as we passed. The sound was almost musical—almost, but not quite. Like a song heard through water, beautiful but distorted.

"I don't accept it," she said finally. "I just live it." She began walking again. "Acceptance comes later. Sometimes never. But living—that's just putting one foot in front of the other. Doing the next thing, and the next thing after that, until suddenly you've been doing it for years and you realize that's just who you are now."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be. Because the alternative is stopping. And stopping means dying." She looked back at me. "You're not ready to die, Kvothe. I can see it in you. The fire is banked, but it's still there. It just needs time to remember how to burn."

---

The village was called Newarre.

We emerged from the between-places on a hillside overlooking a valley so ordinary it almost hurt to look at. Fields of wheat and barley, neatly divided by stone fences. A handful of houses clustered around a crossroads. A general store with a faded sign. A smithy with smoke rising from its chimney.

And an inn.

A simple building of grey stone and dark wood, with windows that caught the afternoon light and a sign that swung gently in the breeze. The sign was weathered, barely readable, showing the faded image of a stone—or perhaps a door, or perhaps nothing at all.

"The inn is empty," Auri said. "The previous owner died last year. No one's claimed it."

"You want me to run an inn?"

"I want you to have somewhere to be. Something to do." She looked at the weathered building with an expression I couldn't quite read. "The silence you carry makes you invisible, in a way. People's eyes slide past you. They don't remember your face."

"A useful trick for a fugitive."

"A useful trait for someone who needs to disappear." She reached into her pocket and produced a key—old iron, heavy with the weight of years. "Stay here. Build a new life. And when you're ready—when you've figured out who you are now—you can decide what comes next."

"What if I'm never ready?"

"Then you stay forever. Run the inn. Serve drinks. Listen to the stories travelers tell." She smiled, and it was the most genuine expression I'd seen from her since Cinder had taken her. "There are worse fates than becoming a keeper of stories."

I took the key.

It was cold in my hand—colder than it should have been, as if it had been waiting for me for a very long time. As if it had been made for me, specifically, in some future that had already happened.

"How do you know about this place?"

"I know about a lot of places. The between-paths connect to everywhere, if you know how to walk them." She began backing away, toward the shimmer in the air that marked the entrance to the paths we'd been walking. "I'll check on you, sometimes. When I can. The Underthing still needs me—there are broken things that need mending, and I've been away too long."

"Auri—"

"You don't have to thank me." She smiled. "You gave me a name, once. When I had none. When I was just a broken thing hiding in the dark. You saw me when no one else could see." She paused at the edge of the shimmer. "This is me returning the favor. Seeing you. When you can't see yourself anymore."

"Will I see you again?"

"When you need me." Her voice drifted back as she began to fade. "I know where you are now. And I'm never as far away as I seem."

Then she was gone.

And I was alone.

In a village that didn't know my name. In front of a building that needed repairs. With a silence inside me that would never fully fade.

---

I walked into the inn.

The door creaked when I pushed it open—a comfortable sound, somehow. The kind of creak that spoke of age and use, of years of people coming and going, of lives lived within these walls.

The common room was dusty.

Cobwebs hung from the ceiling, and the furniture was covered with sheets that had yellowed with age. The bar was solid oak, dark with polish that had accumulated over decades, and behind it stood shelves that had once held bottles but now held only dust.

I set down my pack.

Looked around at the empty room.

And for the first time in months, I felt something that wasn't grief or guilt or the vast, patient emptiness of silence.

I felt... possibility.

Not hope—not yet. But the faint stirring of something that might, someday, become hope. The sense that this place, this empty building in this forgotten village, could be something. Could hold something. Could become a life, if I let it.

I began to clean.

---

It took months to make the place habitable.

I fixed the roof first—the winter rains were coming, and the old shingles were more gap than coverage. Then the windows, which were cracked and drafty and let in cold air that the fireplace couldn't quite dispel. Then the bar, which needed sanding and polishing and repair in a dozen places where the wood had warped or split.

The work was good.

Physical, demanding, requiring no gifts I'd lost. Just hands and tools and the patient persistence of someone with nothing better to do. I fell into a rhythm: wake before dawn, work until dark, eat whatever simple meal I'd prepared, sleep, repeat.

The silence inside me settled as I worked.

Not smaller—it was never smaller. But... calmer. Less hungry. As if the physical labor was feeding it in some way, giving it something to consume that wasn't my memories or my grief.

Spring came.

I planted a garden behind the inn—vegetables mostly, but also herbs for cooking and flowers because I remembered that my mother had always kept flowers. The soil was good, dark and rich, and things grew quickly in it.

Summer followed.

I finished the renovations, opened the inn for business. The first customers were farmers from nearby homesteads, curious about the stranger who had taken over the old building. They were polite but wary, the way people are with anyone new.

I served them ale. Listened to their stories. Asked no questions and answered few.

They accepted me.

Not warmly—not yet. But with the practical acceptance of people who understood that strangers sometimes appeared and strangers sometimes stayed and that was simply how the world worked.

I called the inn the Waystone.

A name that meant nothing and everything. A reference to paths between places—the kind Auri had shown me, the kind that connected everywhere to everywhere else. A reminder of what I'd lost and what I'd found.

And as the seasons turned, as the months became years, I stopped being Kvothe.

Not all at once. Not completely. But piece by piece, the legend faded. The red of my hair seemed to dim, or perhaps that was just my imagination. The sharp edges of my features softened into something more ordinary. The stories became distant—tales about someone else, someone I had known once but no longer was.

And what remained was simpler. Quieter.

A man called Kote.

Who ran an inn.

Who kept silence.

Who waited.

---

Denna reached for me sometimes.

Not often—the binding spread her too thin for frequent contact, stretched her across the vast fabric of reality in ways that made direct communication nearly impossible. But occasionally, in the quiet hours before dawn, when the inn was empty and the world was still, I would feel her presence.

Like warmth at the edge of awareness.

Like a whisper I couldn't quite hear.

*Still here,* she would say—not in words, exactly, but in the shape of feeling. *Still holding.*

*I know,* I would answer, in the same wordless way. *I'm holding too.*

And we would be silent together, connected across the vast distance between what is and what was. Two pieces of the same broken thing, somehow still fitting together.

The connection was comfort and pain in equal measure.

Comfort because she was still there, still existed, still held some echo of the woman I had loved. Pain because I could never reach her, never touch her, never see her face or hear her voice or argue with her about songs and stories the way we used to do.

She was everywhere and nowhere.

Part of everything and nothing.

The seal that held the world together, and the wound that held me apart.

---

Years passed.

The inn became established. A place where travelers stopped on their way to somewhere else, where farmers gathered on cold nights, where the occasional merchant would pause for a meal before continuing their journey.

I became Kote completely.

The man who ran the Waystone. The innkeeper with the strange red hair and the silent manner. The one who listened more than he spoke, who moved with a grace that seemed out of place in such ordinary surroundings, who sometimes stared at nothing with eyes that had seen too much.

The villagers accepted me as one of their own.

Not because they knew me—they would never know me, not really. But because I was there, day after day, year after year, reliable and unremarkable. Because I helped with the harvest when hands were needed, and kept the inn open on cold nights when travelers needed warmth, and never asked questions that people didn't want to answer.

I became invisible.

Not in the way Auri had meant—though the silence did make me harder to notice, harder to remember. But in the way that ordinary people are invisible. The way that those who serve and listen and ask nothing in return fade into the background of other people's lives.

It was peaceful.

It was painful.

It was all I had left.

---

For what, I didn't know.

But I waited anyway.

Because waiting was what I had left. Because somewhere, stretched across the fabric of reality, Denna was waiting too. And as long as she waited, as long as she held the doors closed and kept the world from ending, I would wait with her.

In silence.

In patience.

In the slow, grinding grief of someone who has lost everything and is still, somehow, alive.

The Waystone Inn stood at the edge of Newarre, grey stone and dark wood, unremarkable and eternal. And inside, a man called Kote polished glasses that didn't need polishing, served drinks to customers who barely noticed him, and listened to stories that other people told.

Waiting.

Always waiting.

For the day when someone would come.

For the day when the story would begin again.

For the day when Kvothe would finally wake up from the long sleep of silence, and remember who he had been, and decide what he would become.

But not today.

Today, he was just Kote.

An innkeeper.

Waiting.
