I SPENT THREE DAYS looking for answers.

I should have spent them looking for Denna. Should have found her, apologized for pushing, let her have her secrets. That would have been the wise thing. The kind thing. The thing that might have saved her life.

Instead, I went to Devi.

Her door was painted the same shade of red I remembered, though the paint had faded in my absence. I knocked three times—the pattern she required—and waited.

The door opened a crack. A single amber eye peered out.

"Well, well." Devi's voice was honey over broken glass. "The prodigal son returns. I was beginning to think you'd died in some forgotten corner of the world and taken my loan with you."

"I have money."

"Of course you do." The door swung wide, revealing Devi in her usual state of dangerously casual elegance. Red hair pulled back, sharp features arranged in an expression of amused predation. "Come in, then. Let's see if it's enough to pay what you owe me."

Her rooms hadn't changed. The same comfortable chaos, the same smell of cinnamon and old books, the same sense that you were sitting in the den of something that could eat you alive if it chose. I settled into my usual chair while Devi poured us both glasses of something dark and expensive.

"Twelve talents," she said, sliding the glass across the table. "Plus eight months of interest. You're up to nineteen now, by my calculation."

I pulled out my purse and counted coins onto the table. Twenty talents—everything I'd earned in Vintas, minus what I needed for this term's tuition. Devi watched with the intense focus of a cat watching a mouse.

"Paid in full," I said. "With a talent to spare."

She swept the coins into a drawer, her expression unreadable. "I'm almost disappointed. I was looking forward to collecting on your blood."

"Maybe next time."

"Maybe." She leaned back, swirling her drink. "But you're not here just to settle accounts, are you? I can see it in your eyes. You want something."

"Information."

"The most expensive commodity." Her smile sharpened. "What kind of information?"

"Yllish written magic."

Devi went very still. It was subtle—a flicker of something behind her eyes, a slight tension in her shoulders. But I'd known her long enough to recognize the signs. She was frightened.

"Why would you want to know about that?"

"Because someone I care about is involved in something dangerous. And I need to understand what I'm dealing with."

"Someone." Her eyes narrowed. "The girl with the dark hair. The one you're always mooning after."

"Her name is Denna."

"I know her name." Devi set down her glass with a sharp click. "I know more than her name, actually. She came to me last month. Wanted information about knot-magic. About how written patterns can bind behavior."

My chest tightened. "What did you tell her?"

"Nothing. I'm not stupid enough to explain that to someone who's clearly in over her head." She leaned forward, and for a moment the predator mask slipped, revealing something almost like concern. "Whatever she's gotten herself into, Kvothe, it's not something you can fix by being clever. Yllish magic is old. Older than the University, older than the Arcanum. It doesn't follow our rules."

"What do you know about it?"

"Enough to know you should stay away." She paused, considering. "But you won't, will you? You'll keep pushing until you find something that breaks you."

"Tell me anyway."

Devi sighed. She stood, crossed to one of her bookshelves, and pulled down a slim volume bound in what might have been leather. Might have been something else.

"Yllish story knots are a form of writing magic," she said, flipping through pages. "Not like sygaldry or sympathy. The knots don't create effects—they *define* them. A properly constructed pattern doesn't just describe reality. It *becomes* reality."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean..." She stopped on a page, frowning at something written there. "If I write a knot that says 'the fire burns cold,' the fire burns cold. Not because I've changed the fire, but because I've changed what 'burning' means within the pattern's influence."

"That sounds like naming."

"It's not naming. Naming requires understanding. This is different—it's authoritative. It tells reality what to be, and reality obeys." She looked up at me, and her eyes were very serious. "The old Yllish masters could write patterns that reshaped cities. They could compose stories that killed their audiences. They could bind souls to objects, compel behavior, erase memory."

"And someone is teaching this to Denna?"

"Someone is using her for it. There's a difference." Devi closed the book. "The patterns don't just affect the world. They affect the writer. Every knot takes something from the person who creates it. Every binding requires a price."

I thought of the shadows under Denna's eyes. The way she'd seemed thinner. The desperation in her voice when she'd said *I can't*.

"What kind of price?"

"It depends on the pattern. Small knots might just take energy—leave you tired, weak. Larger ones..." She shrugged. "There are stories about old Yllish scribes who wrote themselves out of existence. Who bound their identities to their work so completely that there was nothing left when they finished."

"And if someone were to write patterns in their hair? Carry them constantly?"

Devi's face went pale. "That would be very dangerous. And very effective. The patterns would be constantly active, constantly drawing from the wearer. They'd become a channel for whatever magic the knots described."

"A channel."

"Or a vessel. Same thing, really." She set the book back on its shelf, her movements careful. "The person I met—Denna—she's already further along than she should be. I could see it in her eyes. Whatever she's becoming, she's almost finished."

I stood. "I need to find her."

"You need to stay away from her." Devi caught my arm, her grip stronger than it looked. "Kvothe. Listen to me. Whoever is doing this to her, they're playing a game you don't understand. And if you get in the way—"

"Then I'll get in the way."

"You'll die. Or worse."

"Then I'll die." I pulled free, heading for the door. "But I won't stand by while someone I love is turned into a weapon."

"Love." Devi's voice stopped me at the threshold. "That's the problem, isn't it? Love makes us stupid. Makes us think we can save people who don't want to be saved."

I looked back at her. In the lamplight, her face was half shadow, half flame.

"Maybe," I said. "But what's the point of being clever if you can't use it to help the people you care about?"

I left before she could answer.

I found Denna at the Bentley the next morning.

She was sitting alone at a corner table, nursing a cup of something that might have been tea. The braids in her hair were more elaborate than before—more knots, more patterns, more of whatever terrible work she was doing to herself.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were wary, but she didn't run.

"May I sit?"

She nodded, not speaking.

I sat across from her, close enough to see the fine lines of exhaustion around her eyes, the slight tremor in her hands as she lifted her cup. Up close, the knots in her hair seemed to shimmer—an optical illusion, or something else entirely.

"I talked to Devi," I said.

"I know."

"She told me about Yllish written magic."

"I'm sure she did." Denna set down her cup. "And now you're here to save me."

"I'm here to help you. There's a difference."

"Is there?" Her voice was very even. Very controlled. "Because from where I'm sitting, it looks a lot like you've decided you know what's best for me. Again."

"Denna—"

"No." She held up a hand. "Let me talk. For once, just... let me talk."

I closed my mouth. Waited.

She took a breath. Let it out slowly. "Do you know what it's like to be powerless? Really powerless? To know that everything you are, everything you have, can be taken away by someone stronger, richer, more connected?"

"I've been poor—"

"Not like me. Not the way I've been." Her eyes met mine, and there was something fierce in them. Something desperate. "I've spent my whole life surviving. Charming my way from one patron to the next, one protector to another, always knowing that the moment I stopped being pretty or clever or useful, I'd be back on the street."

"I know—"

"You don't know. You can't know. Because even when you had nothing, you had your mind. Your talent. Your *magic*." The word came out bitter. "Do you understand what I would have given for that? For the power to change my own life, instead of waiting for someone else to change it for me?"

"Is that what he offered you? Your patron? Power?"

"He offered me knowledge." She laughed—a hollow sound. "The same thing you chase through your Archives and your Arcanum. He showed me that there are other ways to shape the world. Ways that don't require admissions or tuition or the approval of old men in robes."

"And the price?"

Her face went still. "Every gift has a price. You know that as well as I do."

"The knots in your hair. They're not just decoration. They're doing something to you." I leaned forward. "Devi told me about written magic. About how it takes from the person who creates it. How it can bind souls, compel behavior—"

"Stop."

"—erase who you are—"

"I said *stop*." She stood so quickly her chair scraped against the floor. The other patrons looked up, startled. "You don't get to come here after eight months and tell me what I am. What I'm becoming."

"Then tell me! Help me understand!" I stood too, facing her across the table. "I'm trying to help you, Denna. But I can't if you won't let me in."

"Let you in." She laughed again—sharp, broken. "You want to know what's happening to me? Fine. I'm being written. Every pattern in my hair, every knot my patron teaches me—it's all part of something larger. A song that will change everything."

"The Lanre song."

"The Lanre song is just the beginning. It's... training. Practice. For what comes next." She looked at me, and for a moment the mask cracked. I saw the girl beneath—frightened, determined, utterly alone. "You don't understand what's coming, Kvothe. What's been building for centuries. The song is going to rewrite history. Rewrite *truth*. And when it's done..."

"When it's done, what? The Chandrian walk free? People forget what they've done?"

"When it's done, the world will finally know the real story. Not the lies that have been passed down for three thousand years. The truth."

"Whose truth? Your patron's?"

Her face hardened again. "The truth is the truth. It doesn't belong to anyone."

"The Chandrian killed my family, Denna. They murdered my parents in front of me. I saw their faces. I heard their *names*. Are you telling me that was a lie?"

"I'm telling you that you don't know what you saw. That you don't know why it happened." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Your father was writing a song, Kvothe. A dangerous song. A song that would have done exactly what you're accusing mine of doing—shaping truth, rewriting history. The difference is, he was writing for the wrong side."

The words hit me like a physical blow. "My father was a good man—"

"I'm sure he was. But good men can be wrong. Good men can be weapons for people who use them." She reached out, touched my cheek. Her hand was cold. "I'm trying to protect you. That's why I didn't want you involved. That's why I kept pushing you away."

"By writing yourself into oblivion?"

"By doing what needs to be done." She pulled her hand back. "You could still walk away. Forget what I've told you. Go back to your classes and your friends and your dreams of revenge."

"I can't do that."

"Can't or won't?"

"Both."

She closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were dry. Resolved.

"Then we have nothing more to say to each other."

She walked away. Again. And this time, I tried to follow. I grabbed her arm, turned her around—

"Don't touch me."

"Denna, please—"

"I said *don't touch me*." Her voice rose to a shout, drawing every eye in the room. "You want to know what your help looks like? It looks like every other man who's ever tried to save me. You don't want to help me—you want to own me. You want me to fit the story you've written in your head about who I should be."

"That's not—"

"It is. It's exactly what you're doing." She pulled free, backing toward the door. "I made a promise. A promise that's costing me more than you'll ever understand. And I did it to protect the people I love. People like *you*."

"What promise? Denna, what did you—"

"Goodbye, Kvothe."

She left.

And I stood there, in the middle of the Bentley, with everyone watching and no one understanding, and I knew—I *knew*—that I'd just lost something I could never get back.

---

"That was it."

The innkeeper's voice was very quiet. Behind the bar, his hands had stopped moving entirely.

Chronicler looked up from his papers. "That was what?"

"The last time we spoke. The last time we actually *talked*, instead of screaming past each other." He laughed—that hollow, broken sound I was becoming too familiar with. "All those words, and we never said the only ones that mattered."

Bast moved closer. "Reshi..."

"I should have told her I loved her." The words came out raw, unpolished. "Right there, in the middle of that crowded room. Should have said 'I love you, and I don't care about your patron or your song or whatever darkness you think you're fighting. I just want you to be safe.'"

"Why didn't you?"

"Pride." The word fell like a stone. "She accused me of wanting to own her. Of not respecting who she was. And I was so angry, so *hurt*, that I couldn't see past it to what she was really saying."

"What was she really saying?"

The innkeeper closed his eyes. When he opened them, they were red.

"Goodbye," he said softly. "She was saying goodbye. And I was too clever to hear it."
