AMBROSE CORNERED ME on the third day.

I'd been careful—varying my routes, keeping to public areas, never walking alone after dark. But Ambrose hadn't survived this long at the University by being predictable, and he knew my patterns better than I knew his.

I was cutting through Tombs, the old lecture hall that nobody used anymore, when I heard the door close behind me. The scrape of boots on stone. The sound of breathing that wasn't my own.

"Kvothe." Ambrose's voice echoed in the empty hall. "I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk."

I turned slowly. He wasn't alone—two of his lackeys flanked him, the kind of muscle that came from old money and too much time in the Sword and Board. But the real threat was Ambrose himself. His smile had an edge I'd never seen before.

"What do you want, Ambrose?"

"Just a conversation." He stepped closer, and his followers moved with him. "I feel like there's been a misunderstanding between us. All this... unpleasantness. The rumors. The petty sabotage." He spread his hands. "It's beneath us, don't you think?"

"I wasn't aware there was any 'us.'"

"There could be." His eyes glittered in the dim light. "My father has plans, Kvothe. Big plans. The kind of plans that could use someone with your... talents. Sympathy, naming, that clever tongue of yours. You could go far, if you allied yourself with the right people."

"And you're the right people?"

"I'm the only people who matter." He stepped closer still. "The Jakis family controls twelve seats on the Iron Law council. We have influence in every major court from Vintas to the Commonwealth. By this time next year, my father will be the most powerful man in the civilized world—not counting the kings who owe him favors."

I kept my face neutral, but something in his words caught my attention. Not the boasting—I was used to that. But the certainty. The specificity. Ambrose wasn't spinning fantasies; he was describing a plan already in motion.

"That's ambitious," I said carefully.

"That's destiny." He smiled—and for a moment, I saw something beneath the arrogance. Something hungry and cold and deeply, deeply afraid. "The world is changing, Kvothe. The old orders are falling. The Amyr are gone, the Chandrian are stirring, and the doors that have been closed for three thousand years are starting to crack."

My blood went cold. "What do you know about the doors?"

"More than you'd think." He tilted his head, studying me. "My family has been preparing for this moment for generations. We know what's coming. We know what has to be done. And we know that the boy who killed the king is either going to be an asset or a liability."

"I haven't killed any king."

"Not yet." His smile widened. "But you will. It's in the stars, Kvothe. Written in the prophecies that my family has been collecting since before the University existed. The Kingkiller. The one who breaks the binding. The one who opens the doors."

He stepped back, and his lackeys relaxed slightly.

"Join us," Ambrose said. "Let us guide you. We can make sure the doors open the right way—that the power flows to the right people. Or stand against us, and we'll make sure you never live long enough to fulfill your destiny."

"That's quite an offer."

"It's the only offer you're going to get." He turned to leave, then paused. "You have until the end of the term. After that... well. Accidents happen at the University. Even to clever students who think they're untouchable."

He walked out. His lackeys followed.

I stood alone in the empty hall, trying to make sense of what I'd just heard.

"He knew," I told Sim and Wilem that night. "About the doors. About the Chandrian. About things that should be impossible for a noble family to know."

We were in Wilem's room, the door locked, a sympathy lamp burning low. The walls were thin in the dormitories, and some conversations needed to stay private.

"The Jakis family is old," Wilem said thoughtfully. "Older than most people realize. There are references to them in texts from before the fall of the Aturan Empire."

"How old?"

"Old enough to have survived the Creation War. At least, their predecessors did." Wilem leaned back in his chair. "The Yllish texts I've been reading—the ones in the restricted section—mention a handful of families who preserved knowledge from the old days. Lineages that kept the secrets alive when everyone else forgot."

"And the Jakis are one of them?"

"Maybe. The names changed over the centuries. But the patterns..." He shook his head. "Someone has been guiding that family for a very long time. Shaping their ambitions. Preparing them for something."

"For the doors to open," I said.

"Or for someone to open them." Sim's voice was quiet. "Kvothe—what if Ambrose isn't the threat here? What if he's just a symptom? A pawn in a game that's been going on longer than any of us have been alive?"

I thought of Bredon and his tak games. Of Elodin's warnings. Of the feeling I'd had for months now—that I was being moved, manipulated, positioned for something I couldn't see.

"Then we need to find out who's really playing," I said. "And what they want."

"How?"

"The same way I always do. We ask questions. We follow trails. We kick over rocks." I stood, began to pace. "Ambrose said his family has prophecies. Records from before the University. If we can find those records—"

"The restricted sections," Wilem said. "They'd be there, if they're anywhere."

"Can you get access?"

"Not easily. But I know someone who might be able to help." He hesitated. "There's a woman. Used to be a student here. Got expelled for... reasons. She runs a lending library now, off the beaten path."

"Devi."

"You know her?"

"We've met." I thought of our conversation—the scars on her arm, the warnings she'd given. "She's been helpful. To a point."

"She knows things about the restricted sections that even the scriv's don't." Wilem leaned forward. "If anyone can tell us where to look, it's her."

"Then we'll ask." I moved toward the door. "Tomorrow. Tonight, I need to think."

"Kvothe—" Sim started.

"I'm fine. Just... I need to be alone for a while. Sort through everything."

I left before they could argue.

I didn't go to my room.

I went to the Underthing instead, to the places Auri had shown me. To the broken room, with its fragments and patterns. To the silence that asked no questions.

I sat among the glittering pieces and thought about prophecies. About families that planned for generations. About doors that were starting to crack and powers that wanted to be on the right side when they opened.

The Jakis family. The Amyr. The Chandrian. All of them circling around something I didn't understand, all of them waiting for something to happen.

And at the center of it all—me.

The Kingkiller. The one who breaks the binding.

The one who opens the doors.

I didn't want it. Hadn't asked for it. But the pieces were falling into place around me, and no amount of wishing would make them stop.

In the darkness of the Underthing, surrounded by broken things that remembered what it meant to be whole, I made a decision.

I would find out what was really happening. Who was really pulling the strings. And when I understood the shape of the game—really understood it—I would find a way to break it.

Not for power. Not for revenge.

For Denna, who was being written by forces she didn't understand.

For my parents, who had died for knowing too much.

For myself, who had never wanted to be a piece in anyone's game.

The broken places around me glittered in the faint light, and somewhere in the depths, water ran over ancient stones.

I would find the truth. Whatever it cost.

"That was the moment," the innkeeper said quietly. "The moment I stopped being a student playing at investigation and started being something else."

"A player?"

"Something like that." He set down his cloth. "I thought I was taking control. Making my own choices. But I was still inside the game, still following rules that had been set centuries before I was born."

"Did you know? At the time?"

"No. I thought I was clever. Thought I could see the patterns that everyone else missed." He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Pride. That was always my weakness. The belief that I could understand things better than the people who had been studying them for lifetimes."

"And Ambrose? Was he really part of some ancient conspiracy?"

"Ambrose was exactly what he appeared to be—a arrogant, ambitious man from a powerful family." The innkeeper shook his head. "But he was also right. About the prophecies. About the doors. About the role I was destined to play."

"Then you did kill a king."

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"I killed many things," he said finally. "The king was just the one people remember."
