I FOUND ELODIN on the roof of the Masters' Hall.

He sat with his legs dangling over the edge, watching the sky with an expression of bemused concentration. When I climbed up beside him, he didn't seem surprised.

"The naming student returns," he said. "I wondered when you'd come."

"You know what's happening."

"I know what everyone knows. The Archives burned. Lorren lies wounded. The boundary between worlds grows thin." He tilted his head. "And somewhere out there, your moon-named lover is being used as a key to open doors that should stay closed."

"You know her name."

"I know many names." He finally looked at me. "The question is whether you know it. Whether you're willing to use it."

"I learned her name. Ludis."

"Ah." Something shifted in his expression—respect, perhaps, or sorrow. "Then you understand what she is. What she's always been."

"A bridge between worlds."

"The bridge. The only living person whose essence touches both realms." Elodin stood, walked along the roof's edge with casual disregard for the drop. "When Jax stole part of the moon's name, he created a rift. When the doors were sealed, that rift was locked in place. And occasionally—rarely—someone is born who embodies that rift. Who carries the wound in their very nature."

"Denna."

"Ludis. The wandering one. The one who is never fully present, because part of her is always on the other side." Elodin stopped at the roof's corner. "Cinder recognized what she was. Used it. Shaped her into a weapon."

"How do I stop him?"

"You can't." Elodin's voice was matter-of-fact. "Cinder has been playing this game for three thousand years. He's survived the deaths of empires, the purges of the Amyr, the rise and fall of gods. You're seventeen years old with three years of education. What do you imagine you can do that countless others haven't tried?"

"Something. Anything."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer I have." I climbed to my feet. "Everyone keeps telling me how impossible this is. How powerful Cinder is. How inevitable the doors' opening has become. But no one tells me to stop trying."

"Because stopping isn't an option." Elodin turned to face me. "You're already involved, Kvothe. The Cthaeh made sure of that. Every step you take is part of a pattern you can't see. The question isn't whether you'll act—it's whether your actions will help or harm."

"How do I know the difference?"

"You don't." He smiled grimly. "That's what makes it interesting."

We talked for hours.

Elodin told me things I'd never heard in any classroom. Things about the Creation War, about the original Namers, about the sealing of the doors.

"There were seven seals," he said. "Seven different kinds of barrier, each requiring different knowledge to break. Physical locks were the simplest—iron and silver and stone. Magical bindings were more complex—names woven into patterns that couldn't be unspoken without knowing the original names."

"And the conceptual seals."

"The hardest to break. And the hardest to reinforce." He sat again, cross-legged on the roof tiles. "A conceptual seal doesn't depend on matter or magic. It depends on belief. On the collective understanding of everyone who touches it."

"So Denna's song—"

"Changes how people think about the Chandrian. About Lanre specifically." Elodin nodded. "If enough people believe the song's version of history, the conceptual seal weakens. Eventually, it fails entirely."

"And Cinder uses that failure to—"

"To power his transformation." Elodin's voice dropped. "That's what no one else has told you, is it? What Cinder truly wants."

"Bredon told me. He wants to become a god."

"Close. He wants to become what he was before the binding." Elodin's eyes met mine. "Cinder wasn't always Chandrian, Kvothe. Before Lanre recruited him, before the war's end, he was something else. Something that the old world would have called a Shaper."

"Like the ones who made Fae."

"Exactly like them. Cinder helped create the Faen realm. He was one of the architects of its making." Elodin's voice was grave. "But the binding that created the Chandrian stripped that power from him. Locked it away. For three thousand years, he's been a shadow of what he was."

"And now he wants it back."

"He wants more than that. The power released when the doors open—if he can channel it properly—won't just restore what he lost. It will make him greater than he ever was." Elodin shook his head. "A Shaper with the accumulated knowledge of three millennia. With no rivals. No enemies who understand what he is."

"A god in all but name."

"In exactly that name." Elodin stood. "And that's why he must be stopped. Not because of what the doors might release—though that's terrible enough. Because of what Cinder will become if he succeeds."

---

"Why are you telling me this?" I asked. "You've never shared this kind of knowledge before."

"Because before, you weren't ready." Elodin walked to the roof's edge. "And because before, there was time. Time to teach you properly. Time to let you grow into the knowledge gradually."

"And now?"

"Now the doors are opening. The seals are failing. And you're the only person in position to do anything about it." He looked at me. "You have her name. You have the counter-song. You have access to information and abilities that no one else possesses. The question is whether you can put them together before it's too late."

"What about you? The other Masters? The Amyr?"

"We'll do what we can. But Cinder has been hunting us for centuries. Most of the people who understood this magic are dead. Most of the knowledge is destroyed." His voice was bitter. "The fire at the Archives—that wasn't random. It was targeted. Cinder burned every text that might have helped us stop him."

"Denna set the fire."

"Her body set the fire. Her hands held the torch." Elodin's eyes were sad. "But it was Cinder's will that guided her. Cinder's purpose that burned the knowledge we needed."

"Then he's already won."

"No." Elodin gripped my shoulder. "He's destroyed our resources. Our backup plans. Our safety nets. But he hasn't won. Not while you're still fighting."

"I'm one person."

"One person with her name. One person who's touched the silence and come back. One person the Cthaeh chose to speak to." His grip tightened. "Do you think that's coincidence? Do you think you ended up here, now, with these specific abilities, by accident?"

"I don't believe in destiny."

"Neither do I. But I believe in patterns. I believe in the way reality shapes itself around certain people." He released my shoulder. "You're at the center of something, Kvothe. Something that began before you were born and will continue after you die. The question isn't whether you're special. The question is what you're going to do about it."

I left the roof with more questions than answers.

But one thing had become clear: I couldn't fight Cinder directly. He was too old, too powerful, too deeply embedded in the patterns of the world. Any direct confrontation would end in my death.

But I could fight indirectly.

I could spread my counter-song. Strengthen the conceptual seal. Make people believe the truth about Lanre instead of Denna's beautiful lies.

I could find Denna. Speak her name. Break—or at least weaken—the binding that held her to Cinder's will.

And I could learn. Keep learning. Find the fragments of knowledge that had survived the fire. Piece together what was needed to reinforce the seals.

It wasn't much. It wasn't enough.

But it was what I had.

That night, I found Auri.

She was waiting in the Underthing, in the chamber she called Mantle, with a expression of worried concentration.

"You're back," she said. "But you're not the same."

"No one's ever the same."

"True." She cocked her head. "But you're more not-the-same than usual. You've learned things that change the shape of you."

"I learned Denna's name."

"Ludis." Auri said the word softly, like a prayer. "The wandering one. The one who carries the door inside her."

"You knew."

"I know many things I don't say." She sat on her stone, drew her knees to her chest. "The moon is breaking, Kvothe. I can feel it. The light that touches everything—it's splitting. Fracturing."

"The seals are failing."

"Everything is failing. The world you know is ending." Her voice was eerily calm. "But that doesn't mean everything is lost. Sometimes things have to end before they can begin again."

"Can you help me? Do you know anything that might—"

"I know the paths." She looked up at me. "The old roads that run beneath the University. Some of them lead to places that were sealed when the doors were sealed. Places where knowledge was hidden. Forgotten."

"Can you show me?"

"I can try." She stood. "But Kvothe—some of those places are dangerous. The sealing wasn't just to keep things out. It was to keep things in."

"I'll take the risk."

"I know you will." She took my hand—her fingers cold and small. "That's what worries me."

She led me into the darkness.

And for the first time since this began, I felt something other than despair.

I felt hope.
