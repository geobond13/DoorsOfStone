THE POWER RETURNED like a flood.

Music and naming and silence, all tangled together into something new. Not what I'd been before—something different. Something that had survived the breaking and emerged stronger for it.

I stood, and the room seemed brighter. The air felt different. The silence inside me was still there, but now it was a tool instead of a burden.

"Reshi?" Bast's voice was awed. "You're—"

"I'm back." The words felt strange in my mouth. "Not the same. But back."

Chronicler scrambled to his feet. "The story—"

"The story is finished. At least, the part I've been hiding from." I looked at the open chest, at the contents that were no longer locked away. "But there's more to tell. More to do."

"The binding," Bast said. "Denna said someone was trying to open the doors."

"Yes. Using the piece of Cinder I absorbed." I closed my eyes, felt for the knowledge I'd kept locked away for so long. "I can feel it now. Someone has been reaching through me, trying to access the seal."

"Who?"

The answer came from outside.

A crash. A scream. The sound of something impossible moving through the village.

---

We ran to the door.

The night outside was wrong. The stars were too bright. The shadows were too deep. And in the center of the road, something that shouldn't exist was standing.

It wasn't Cinder—he was gone forever. But it wore his shape, sort of. A reconstruction made from the memories I'd absorbed. A fragment given form by whatever force was trying to open the doors.

"The seal knows I'm awake," I said. "It knows the chest is open."

"What is that thing?"

"A shadow. An echo. The last piece of what Cinder was, trying to finish what he started." I stepped forward. "Stay back. Both of you."

"Reshi, you can't—"

"I can." For the first time in years, I felt certain. "This is what I was made for. What I've been waiting for without knowing it."

I walked toward the shadow.

It turned to face me with eyes that held nothing but hunger.

"Kvothe," it said, with a voice like breaking glass. "You locked me away. Made me small."

"You're not Cinder."

"I'm what remains. The echo of a echo. But I'm enough." It moved closer. "Enough to finish opening the doors. Enough to undo everything you sacrificed."

"No." I reached for the power I'd reclaimed. The music. The naming. The silence. "You're not enough for anything. You're a shadow pretending to be real."

"Shadows have power."

"Not as much as they think."

I called the wind.

It came—not the wind I'd known before, but something touched by silence. A wind that made no sound, that moved without announcing itself.

The shadow laughed.

"You think that will stop me? I'm made of silence too."

"No. You're made of fear." I drew deeper. "You're made of the parts of Cinder I couldn't accept. The parts I locked away because they terrified me."

"Fear is power."

"Fear is fuel." I spoke the name of silence—my silence, the one I'd carried for years. "And I'm done being afraid."

---

The shadow dissolved.

Not slowly. Not dramatically. It simply... stopped existing. Unmade by the same power that had unmade Cinder, wielded by someone who finally understood it.

The night returned to normal.

The stars dimmed to their proper brightness.

And I stood in the road, feeling the full weight of what I'd become.

Behind me, Bast and Chronicler were silent.

"It's done," I said, without turning. "For now."

"For now?"

"The shadow was just the beginning. The doors are weakening again. The binding that Denna holds—it needs to be reinforced." I turned to face them. "There's work to do."

"Where?" Chronicler asked.

"Everywhere. The seal spans the world. The cracks are forming in a hundred places." I looked at Bast. "I need to travel. Fight. Do what I should have been doing all along instead of hiding."

"I'm coming with you."

"No. You need to stay here. Watch the inn. Be the anchor that keeps this place connected to the real world."

"But Reshi—"

"There will be others coming. People who heard my story. People who want to help." I smiled—the first real smile I'd felt in years. "They'll need somewhere to gather. Somewhere to find each other."

"The Waystone."

"The Waystone." I walked past them, back into the inn. "Pack what we need. I leave at dawn."

---

They worked through the night.

I spent the time differently.

I sat in the corner of the common room, holding my lute for the first time since the chest opened. The strings were dusty. The wood was worn.

But when I touched them, music came.

Not the old music—something new. Something that carried the silence within it. Notes that created space as much as sound.

I played until dawn.

And when the sun rose, I walked out of the Waystone with a lute on my back and power in my heart.

Behind me, Bast waved from the doorway.

Ahead of me, the road stretched toward everything I'd been avoiding.

The binding needed reinforcing.

The doors needed guarding.

And somewhere, scattered across the seal, Denna was waiting.

I was Kvothe again.

Broken and remade and ready to fight.

Whatever came next, I would face it.

Not as the hero of legends.

Not as the disaster of reality.

Just as myself.

The man who had given everything and somehow still had more to give.

I walked into the rising sun.

And the story continued.
