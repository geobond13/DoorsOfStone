DEVI'S ROOMS SMELLED of cinnamon and old secrets.

I'd come to settle my debt—the talents I still owed her from before my travels. But I'd also come for information. Devi knew things. She'd been expelled from the Arcanum for reasons nobody discussed openly, which meant she'd pushed boundaries that most students never even saw.

"You want to know about Yllish magic." She said it as a statement, not a question. "Specifically, written magic. Knot-patterns that compel behavior."

"How did you—"

"I'm observant. You've been asking questions in the Archives. You visited Elodin. You've been seen near the restricted sections." She smiled, sharp as a blade. "And you have a particular look in your eyes. The look of someone who's found something disturbing and wants to understand it before it's too late."

I sat down across from her. The usual chair, the usual distance. Devi was dangerous, but she was also one of the most brilliant minds I'd ever encountered. If anyone could help me understand what was happening to Denna, it was her.

"Tell me about the restricted sections," I said. "The books that are locked away. The knowledge that's been... pruned."

Her expression flickered. Just for a moment. Then the mask was back.

"What do you know about pruning?"

"Lorren mentioned it. In passing. He said there are gaps in the collection. Intentional gaps."

"He told you that?" Devi leaned back, surprised. "That's... unexpected. Lorren doesn't usually acknowledge the pruning to students. Or to anyone."

"Why not?"

"Because acknowledging it raises questions. Questions like: who decides what gets removed? And why? And what happens to the knowledge that disappears?" She stood, walked to her bookshelf, ran her fingers across the spines. "I know the answers to those questions. That's part of why I was expelled."

"Tell me."

She pulled out a bottle of something amber, poured two glasses. This was new. Devi didn't usually drink with clients.

"The Archives aren't just a collection," she said, handing me a glass. "They're a *curated* collection. Someone—several someones, actually, across centuries—has been deciding what knowledge is safe for the world to have. And what knowledge is too dangerous to exist."

"The Amyr."

She went very still.

"Where did you hear that name?"

"Multiple sources. All of them telling me to stop asking questions." I drank, felt the burn. "Which only makes me want to ask more."

"Of course it does. You're Kvothe." She smiled, but there was something sad in it. "I was the same way, once. Convinced that knowledge was power, and power was safety, and if I could just learn enough, I could protect myself from anything."

"What changed?"

"I learned something I shouldn't have. Something about the people who control the pruning. And they made sure I understood the consequences of knowing."

She pulled down her sleeve. On her inner arm, a scar—pale and old, but unmistakable.

*Yllish knots.*

"They wrote on you?"

"Just once. Just enough to make the point." She covered the scar again. "The pattern was a binding. Compelled me to keep their secrets. But bindings fade if you know how to work around them. And I've had years to figure out the loopholes."

"What secrets?"

"The same ones you're stumbling toward. The truth about the Chandrian. The truth about the Amyr. The truth about the doors that keep the world from falling apart." She finished her drink, set the glass down hard. "And the truth about Lorren."

"Lorren?"

"He's one of them. Has been for decades. Maybe longer—the Amyr have ways of extending life, if you're valuable enough." She met my eyes. "That's why the Archives are pruned. That's why certain knowledge disappears. Because the Amyr need it gone, and Lorren is their instrument."

I thought about my conversations with the Master Archivist. The way he watched me. The warnings he'd given.

"He warned me," I said slowly. "When I came back. He said there were doors that only opened one way."

"He was trying to protect you. In his way. The Amyr aren't evil, Kvothe. They're not even wrong, most of the time. They're just... ruthless. Willing to sacrifice anything—anyone—for what they see as the greater good."

"Including pruning knowledge that might help people?"

"Including pruning knowledge that might *destroy* people." She refilled her glass. "The books they've removed aren't just historical curiosities. They're weapons. Instructions for magic that could crack the world open. Rituals that could summon things that haven't walked the earth for three thousand years."

"Yllish written magic."

"Among other things. Yes." She looked at me carefully. "You're asking about this because of your friend. The dark-haired girl. The one with the patron who beats her."

"How do you know about—"

"She came to me. Months ago. Asking the same questions you're asking now." Devi's voice softened. "I couldn't help her. The bindings on me... there are things I can't say, even now. But I could see what was happening. I could see the patterns forming in her hair, in her movements. Someone was writing her. Turning her into something."

"Into what?"

"I don't know. But I know it's not good. And I know it's almost finished." She reached across the table, gripped my hand. "Whatever you're planning, Kvothe—whatever heroic gesture you're thinking of making—be careful. The people behind this have been playing this game for millennia. They're not going to be stopped by a clever student with good intentions."

"Then what am I supposed to do?"

"I don't know." She let go of my hand. "But I know you're going to do something. You always do. Just..." She hesitated. "Try not to destroy everything in the process. That's the Amyr's specialty. Don't become them in your rush to defeat them."

---

I left Devi's rooms with more questions than answers.

The Amyr. The Chandrian. The pruned Archives. All of it connected in ways I was only beginning to understand.

And at the center of it all—Denna. Being written. Being shaped. Becoming something that might already be beyond saving.

I had to find her. Had to understand what was happening to her before it was too late.

But first, I needed to know more about Yllish magic. More about the bindings that could be carved into flesh. More about the patterns that could compel behavior.

If Denna was being written, maybe I could learn to read her.

And maybe—just maybe—I could find a way to rewrite the story.
