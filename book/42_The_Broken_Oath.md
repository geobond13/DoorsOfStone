THE SILENCE WAS eating me.

Not quickly—not like at Renere, when it had surged up and consumed everything in its path. This was slower. More insidious. A piece at a time, taken when I wasn't looking.

I noticed it first with my music.

We had stopped for the night in a sheltered hollow, and Simmon—trying to lift our spirits—had produced a small wooden flute he'd been carrying since the University. He played a simple tune, a children's song about stars and wishes, and the melody was so familiar it made my chest ache.

I tried to hum along.

No sound came out.

Not because I was choosing silence. Because the silence was choosing me.

"Kvothe?" Sim stopped playing. "Are you alright?"

"Fine." I cleared my throat, tried again. Nothing. "I'm fine."

But I wasn't fine. And we all knew it.

The oath I'd sworn to Denna was breaking me.

I hadn't understood it at first—the connection between the promise I'd made and the power I'd used. But as the days passed, as we traveled deeper into the Eld, the pattern became impossible to ignore.

I had sworn on my name, my power, and my good left hand that I would not seek her patron.

I had broken that oath. Spectacularly.

And now my name was slipping away. My power was turning against me. And my left hand—my chord hand, my writing hand, the hand that had shaped music and magic for as long as I could remember—

It wouldn't work properly anymore.

"Let me see," Fela said, on the fifth night.

I held out my hand. She took it gently, examined the fingers, the palm, the way my grip had weakened.

"There's no physical damage," she said. "No injury I can find."

"It's not physical."

"Then what is it?"

"The oath." I pulled my hand back. "When I swore to Denna—on my name, my power, my good left hand—I bound myself. Made a promise with the weight of naming behind it."

"And when you broke the promise..."

"The binding turned against me. Started taking back what I'd sworn on." I flexed my fingers. They moved, but sluggishly, as if they belonged to someone else. "First my name started slipping—that's why I can't speak sometimes, why the silence fills my mouth when I try to make sound. Then my power—the silence is eating my ability to name, to shape, to do anything but spread more silence."

"And your hand?"

I looked at it. At the fingers that had once danced across lute strings with effortless grace.

"My hand is dying. Slowly. One nerve at a time."

---

Devi had a theory.

"Naming oaths are tricky," she said, as we walked through a morning fog so thick it muffled even our footsteps. "They're not like regular promises. They're bindings—sympathetic links between the swearer and the thing sworn on."

"I know how naming oaths work."

"Then you know that breaking them doesn't just release the binding. It inverts it." She ducked under a low branch. "Whatever you swore on becomes a weapon against you. Your name, your power, your hand—they're not just failing. They're actively working to unmake you."

"Is there a way to stop it?"

"Maybe. If you could fulfill the oath retroactively—give Denna's patron what you swore not to seek—the binding might release."

"Denna's patron is Cinder. And Cinder is trapped on the other side of a door that won't open for centuries."

"Then find another way." She looked back at me. "You're the cleverest person I've ever met, Kvothe. If there's a loophole, you'll find it."

"And if there isn't?"

"Then you'll die. Slowly, painfully, losing pieces of yourself until there's nothing left." She turned away. "But at least you'll die knowing you tried."

---

That night, I dreamed of Denna.

Not the Denna I'd held at the end—bloody and broken and fading. The Denna from before. From the caravan road, when we first met. From the Eolian, when she sang songs that made the world weep. From a hundred moments, scattered across years, when she had been the brightest thing in my life.

*You broke your promise,* dream-Denna said.

*I know.*

*You swore you wouldn't seek my patron. You swore on everything you are.*

*I had to stop him. He was going to—*

*I know what he was going to do.* Her eyes were sad. *I know why you did it. But oaths don't care about reasons. They only care about truth.*

*Then tell me how to fix it. Tell me how to make it right.*

*You can't.* She touched my face—her hand warm, real, achingly familiar. *The oath is broken. The price is being paid. All you can do now is decide how to spend what's left.*

*What does that mean?*

*It means you have a choice.* She was fading now, dissolving into the silence that surrounded us both. *Keep fighting the breaking—and let it destroy you piece by piece. Or accept it—and become something new.*

*I don't want to become something new. I want to be myself.*

*You haven't been yourself since the night your parents died.* Her voice was barely a whisper. *You've just been pretending. Wearing masks, playing roles, being whoever the moment required.*

*That's not true.*

*Isn't it?* She smiled—the sad, knowing smile that had always seen through me. *Think about it, Kvothe. All the names you've worn. All the faces you've shown. Were any of them really you?*

I couldn't answer.

*That's what I thought.* She was almost gone now, just a suggestion of warmth in the darkness. *Stop fighting. Stop pretending. Let the masks fall away, and see what's underneath.*

*What if there's nothing underneath?*

*Then at least you'll know.*

She vanished.

And I woke to find tears on my face and silence in my throat.

The Eld grew darker as we traveled.

Not literally—the sun still rose and set, the stars still wheeled overhead—but in other ways. The paths grew harder to find. The animals grew scarcer. The sense of being watched grew stronger.

"We're being followed," Simmon said, on the eighth day.

"I know."

"Not soldiers. Something else." He looked over his shoulder at the shadows between the trees. "Something that moves without sound."

"The Sithe, maybe. Guardians of the Cthaeh." I kept walking. "Or something older. Something that lives in places like this."

"Should we be worried?"

"We should always be worried." I ducked under a branch. "But whatever's following us hasn't attacked yet. That means it's curious, not hungry."

"How is that better?"

"Curious things can be negotiated with. Hungry things just eat."

We walked in silence for a while. The silence—the real silence, not the one inside me—pressed close, heavy with the weight of ancient trees and forgotten stories.

"Kvothe," Simmon said finally. "What are we actually looking for out here?"

"An inn."

"You've said that. But what does that mean? Why would there be an inn in the middle of nowhere?"

I thought about how to answer.

"There are places," I said slowly, "where the world is thin. Where the boundaries between what is and what could be grow soft. The Fae touches the mortal world in those places. Time moves differently. Names have different weight."

"And this inn is one of those places?"

"If I'm right about what Skarpi told me—yes." I looked ahead, toward a break in the trees that might have been a clearing. "It's a waystone. A marker for travelers between worlds. A place where someone could hide from anything—including themselves."

"That sounds..."

"Dangerous? Desperate? Like the kind of place only a man with nothing left to lose would seek out?"

"I was going to say sad." Sim's voice was quiet. "It sounds sad, Kvothe. Like an ending."

"Maybe it is." I started toward the clearing. "But endings are just the beginnings of what comes next."

---

The inn wasn't in the clearing.

But something else was.

A woman, small and slight, with hair like dandelion fluff and eyes that held the moon. She was sitting on a fallen log, waiting, as if she'd known we would come this way.

"Hello, Kvothe," Auri said.

I stopped.

Stared.

Felt something in my chest crack open—something I hadn't known was still intact.

"Auri." My voice came out broken. "How did you—"

"I followed the wrongness." She stood, crossed to me with quick, light steps. "It smelled like you. Like the silence you carry now." She took my hand—my broken left hand—and held it gently. "Oh, Kvothe. What have you done to yourself?"

"I broke an oath."

"Yes. I can feel it. The pieces that are falling away." She looked up at me with those moon-bright eyes. "You're becoming unmade."

"I know."

"That's very sad." She squeezed my hand. "But also very brave. You're letting go of who you were to become who you need to be."

"That's not—I'm not choosing this. It's happening to me."

"Is it?" She tilted her head. "Or are you finally stopping choosing against it?"

I didn't have an answer.

"Come," she said, still holding my hand. "I know where the inn is. I'll take you there."

"How do you know about the inn?"

"I know lots of things." She smiled—a small, secret smile. "I know about the places between. The cracks where things slip through. The doors that open both ways." She started walking, pulling me gently along. "I know where you need to go to become safe. And I know what it will cost."

"What will it cost?"

She looked back at me. Her eyes were bright with something that might have been tears.

"Everything you have left," she said. "But that's alright. It's not very much anymore."

She led us into the forest.

And I followed, because she was right.

I didn't have much left to lose.
