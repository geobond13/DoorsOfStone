THE WAYSTONE INN was silent.

Not the magical silence of Kvothe's telling, but something else. Something older and heavier. The silence of three men sitting in the wreckage of a story, each one trying to understand what they'd just heard.

The innkeeper—Kote—stood behind the bar. His hands were flat on the wood, knuckles white. He hadn't moved since finishing the last sentence. He hadn't looked up.

Chronicler's pen hovered over the page, trembling. A drop of ink fell, spreading like blood on parchment.

Bast sat by the window, his face buried in his hands.

"You didn't mean to kill her."

Chronicler's voice broke the silence like a stone through glass. It sounded wrong in the quiet—too loud, too present.

"Does that matter?" The innkeeper's voice was hollow. "Does intention change what's dead?"

"But you were trying to save her. To stop the song—"

"I killed her." The words came out flat, final. "I killed her and I killed the King and I broke the binding that held the world together. Intention doesn't matter. Results matter. And the results of my cleverness..." He laughed—that hollow, broken sound that held no humor at all. "The results speak for themselves."

Chronicler set down his pen. His hand was shaking too badly to write anyway.

"They call you Kingkiller," he said. "Like it was assassination. Like you planned it."

"It was worse than assassination. At least an assassin knows what he's doing." The innkeeper finally looked up, and his eyes were red. "I was so focused on Cinder that I didn't see the King standing in my way. I was so focused on stopping the song that I didn't understand *what* the song was. Denna wasn't singing magic—she *was* the magic. Kill one and you kill the other."

"You saved the world."

"Did I?" His voice sharpened. "The Scrael are spreading. The binding is cracking. Things are seeping through that haven't walked the earth for three thousand years. And the Maer—the Penitent King—has spent years hunting me because I murdered his friend and opened the door to chaos."

"But Cinder—"

"Is wounded. Diminished. Not dead. He's still out there, waiting. Still planning. Still doing whatever ancient creatures do when their schemes are interrupted." The innkeeper picked up his cloth, then set it down again. His hands wouldn't stop shaking. "I didn't stop anything. I just delayed it. Bought time that I've wasted hiding in a hole, pretending to be someone else."

Bast finally spoke. His voice was muffled by his hands.

"Reshi. You have to finish the story."

"I just did. That's the ending. King dead. Woman dead. World breaking. Hero hiding in an inn, waiting to die." The innkeeper's voice cracked. "What more do you want?"

"I want to know what happened next." Bast lowered his hands. His face was wet with tears—something Chronicler had never seen, something that looked utterly wrong on those too-sharp features. "I want to know how you got here. How you built the chest. How you became... this."

"Why? So you can judge me? Understand me?"

"So I can help you." Bast stood, crossing to the bar. "Reshi. We're running out of time. The soldiers are coming. The darkness is spreading. And you're sitting here, confessing your sins to a chronicler who can't do anything but write them down."

"What else can I do?"

"You can *finish*." Bast's hands slammed down on the bar, making both Chronicler and the innkeeper jump. "You can tell the whole story, and then you can decide what to do with it. But you can't stay frozen here forever, caught between the man you were and the man you're becoming."

The innkeeper stared at him. For a long moment, something passed between them—something older than words, deeper than understanding.

"The chest," Chronicler said quietly. Both of them turned to look at him. "You said you built a chest with three locks. That you put parts of yourself inside."

"Yes."

"And that's why you can't... why you're not..."

"Why I'm not Kvothe anymore." The innkeeper's voice was very soft. "Yes. I tore out the parts of myself that cause disaster. The flame. The thunder. The clever ruthlessness that killed everyone I loved." He looked at his hands—hands that had once called wind and shaped fire, that had stopped the breath of a woman. "I locked them away where they couldn't hurt anyone."

"And now?"

"Now they're upstairs. In a box I can't open." He smiled—sad, broken. "The lock requires Kvothe to open it. And Kvothe is gone. There's just Kote left. The disaster who's already happened."

Bast moved around the bar, standing beside him. "Reshi. Listen to me. The story is almost done. One more piece. Just tell us what happened after Renere—how you escaped, how you built the chest, how you came to be here—and then..."

"And then what?"

"And then you decide." Bast's voice was very quiet. "Stay in the box you've built. Or break it open and face what comes out."

The innkeeper—Kote—looked at his student. His friend. The only person who still called him by a name that meant something.

Outside, the afternoon was fading toward evening. The storm that had been threatening all day was finally beginning to break—rain pattering against the windows, thunder rumbling in the distance.

"One more piece," Kote said finally. "Then it's done."

He took a breath. Let it out slowly.

"After Renere, Auri led me through the dark places. The spaces between. And when I finally surfaced, I had to decide what to do with what was left of me..."

He began to speak again, and Chronicler's pen began to move, and outside the storm continued to build.

The third day was almost over.

And the silence was waiting to be broken.
