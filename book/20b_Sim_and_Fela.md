THERE ARE DAYS that shine.

Not because of what happens in them—sometimes nothing happens at all—but because of how they feel. Days when the world seems gentler, the shadows less dark, the weight on your shoulders momentarily lifted. Days you remember later, when everything has gone wrong, and wonder if they were real or just fever dreams of a happier time.

This was one of those days.

---

Anker's was crowded that evening, but we'd claimed our usual corner table—the one near the fireplace, where the light was warm and the draft from the door didn't reach. Wilem was shuffling cards with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd won more games than he'd lost. Simmon was attempting to explain something about the theoretical properties of moonlight to a deeply skeptical Fela. And I was watching them, nursing a mug of ale and feeling, for the first time in weeks, something like peace.

"You're being ridiculous," Fela said, though she was smiling. "Moonlight doesn't have sympathetic properties. It's just reflected sunlight."

"Reflected sunlight with completely different characteristics!" Sim leaned forward, his enthusiasm making him forget his drink. "The wavelengths change during reflection. The angle of incidence affects the—"

"You're making words up now."

"I am not! 'Angle of incidence' is a perfectly legitimate term!"

"Said in a perfectly illegitimate context."

Wilem dealt the cards, his expression carefully neutral. "They've been doing this for an hour," he murmured to me. "I've given up trying to follow."

"It's called flirting," I said. "Albeit disguised as academic debate."

"Is that what flirting looks like among scholars?"

"Among these particular scholars, yes."

Wil considered this. "It seems inefficient."

"Most things worth doing are."

We played cards while Sim and Fela continued their argument-that-wasn't-an-argument.

The game was Corners—a Cealdish variant that Wil had taught us, involving complicated bidding, strategic discards, and enough complexity to keep half your attention while the other half wandered. I was losing, as usual. Wil was winning, as usual. And the comfortable familiarity of the ritual was exactly what I needed.

"You're distracted," Wil observed, taking another trick.

"I'm always distracted."

"More than usual. You've misplayed three hands in a row." He studied me across the table. "Is it the thing you won't tell us about?"

"Which thing?"

"The one involving Denna. The one that's been keeping you up nights." His voice was matter-of-fact. "You think we haven't noticed, but we have."

I looked at my cards, not seeing them. "It's complicated."

"Love usually is."

"It's not—" I stopped. Started again. "There are things happening. Things I can't explain. And Denna's caught up in them, and I don't know how to help her."

"Have you asked her what kind of help she wants?"

"She doesn't know what's happening to her. Not really. She thinks—" I shook my head. "She thinks it's something she chose. Something she's in control of. But it's not. It's..."

"Something you can see that she can't?"

"Yes."

Wil was quiet for a moment, organizing his cards with unnecessary precision.

"That's dangerous," he said finally. "Believing you understand someone's situation better than they do. Sometimes it's true. Usually it's just arrogance dressed up as concern."

"And if it's true?"

"Then you have two choices. You can tell her what you see, and risk her not believing you. Or you can let her discover it herself, and be there when she does."

"Neither of those sounds good."

"No. But those are usually the only options when you love someone." He laid down his hand—a winning combination I should have seen coming three moves ago. "The alternative is deciding for her. And that never ends well."

---

Fela's laughter cut through my brooding.

"You're impossible," she was telling Sim, but the words had no edge to them. "Completely, utterly impossible."

"I prefer 'consistently unconventional.'"

"You would." She turned to include me in the conversation. "Kvothe, settle this. Does moonlight have independent sympathetic properties, or is Sim just inventing pseudoscience to sound impressive?"

"Moonlight has been used in sympathetic bindings since the Aturan era," I said. "There are texts describing rituals that only work under specific lunar conditions."

"That doesn't mean the moonlight itself is special. It could be the timing, or the psychological state of the practitioner, or—"

"Or," Sim interrupted triumphantly, "it could be the moonlight."

"That's not evidence. That's supposition."

"All knowledge starts as supposition. Then we test it, refine it, and eventually it becomes accepted fact."

"You're quoting Master Herma."

"Am I? I thought I was being brilliantly original."

Fela shook her head, but she was smiling. The kind of smile that has nothing to do with what's being said and everything to do with who's saying it.

I watched them—really watched—and felt something complicated move through my chest.

This was what love looked like when it wasn't tangled in mystery and danger and impossible situations. This was what it could be: easy laughter, comfortable debate, the simple pleasure of being in someone's presence. Sim and Fela had found something good, something real, and they were building it together, one moment at a time.

I wondered what that felt like.

I wondered if I'd ever know.

---

"You're brooding again," Sim said, having apparently won his argument through sheer persistence. "I can see it in your eyes. That Kvothe-is-contemplating-the-universe expression."

"I'm not brooding. I'm... reflecting."

"On what?"

I gestured at the table, at the cards and mugs and comfortable clutter. "On this. On how good this is. On how much I'll miss it."

Sim's expression shifted. "Miss it? Are you going somewhere?"

"Eventually. Everything ends eventually." I tried to smile. "I just mean—we're here, now, together, and it's good. That's worth noticing."

"That's remarkably philosophical for someone who just lost spectacularly at Corners."

"Wil cheats."

"I do not cheat," Wil said mildly. "I simply pay attention to things you miss while contemplating the universe."

Fela reached across the table and touched my hand. "Whatever's worrying you—you know we're here, right? All of us. You don't have to carry things alone."

"I know."

"Do you? Because you have a tendency to gather weight and never share it. Like you think asking for help is some kind of weakness."

"It's not that. It's..."

"It's that you think you're protecting us," Sim finished. "By not telling us what's wrong. By handling everything yourself so we don't have to worry."

I didn't answer. He was more right than I wanted to admit.

"Here's the thing," Fela said. "We worry anyway. We see you struggling, and we don't know why, and that's worse than knowing the truth. At least if we knew, we could help. We could share the weight."

"Some weights aren't meant to be shared."

"That's a nice-sounding sentence that doesn't actually mean anything." Her voice was gentle but firm. "Let us help, Kvothe. Whatever it is. Let us be part of your story, not just observers watching you fight alone."

---

We ordered more drinks.

The evening deepened, the crowd at Anker's shifting as people came and went, but our corner stayed constant. Wil produced a deck of different cards—a game he'd learned from traders in Celdish, something involving memory and bluffing and a frankly ridiculous number of rules.

"This is unnecessarily complicated," Sim observed, after losing three hands in a row.

"That's what you said about Corners. And about Tak. And about every game that requires thinking more than two moves ahead."

"I prefer games where you can succeed through charm and personality."

"Those aren't games. Those are conversations."

"Conversations are games," Fela said. "Just with different rules and no clear winners."

"That's almost philosophical."

"I have hidden depths."

Sim looked at her with an expression I recognized—the kind of look that sees someone and loves what it sees, purely and without reservation. "You really do," he said. "It's one of my favorite things about you."

She blushed. Actually blushed. I'd known Fela for years, watched her face down arrogant nobles and condescending masters without flinching, and here she was, reddening at a compliment from Simmon.

"You two are disgustingly adorable," I said. "I want you to know that."

"We're not—" Sim started.

"You are. It's sickening and wonderful and I'm very happy for you both."

"When did we become the topic of conversation?"

"When you started gazing into each other's eyes like characters in a badly written romance."

Wil snorted. "He's not wrong."

"Et tu, Wilem?"

"I call things as I see them." He gathered the cards, began shuffling for another round. "You're in love. It's obvious. Stop pretending otherwise."

Sim and Fela exchanged a look. The kind of look that has an entire conversation in it, compressed into a moment.

"Fine," Sim said finally. "Yes. We're... something. We've been something for a while now."

"We know."

"How long have you known?"

"Since you started finding excuses to sit next to her at every meal. And she started finding excuses to touch your arm during conversations. And you both started finishing each other's sentences without noticing."

"That's... incredibly observant."

"It's incredibly obvious." I raised my mug. "To Sim and Fela. May your happiness continue to nauseate the rest of us."

They laughed, and we drank, and for a while—just a little while—everything was exactly as it should be.

Late that night, walking back to my room, Wil fell into step beside me.

"You're still carrying something," he said. "Something big. I can see it in how you hold your shoulders."

"You're remarkably perceptive today."

"I'm remarkably perceptive every day. I just don't usually mention it."

We walked in silence for a moment, our footsteps echoing on the cobblestones.

"There's a story," Wil said finally. "In my country. About a man who carried a stone. He found it when he was young, and it was beautiful, and he thought he'd never seen anything so precious. So he picked it up and carried it with him everywhere he went."

"Let me guess. The stone got heavier."

"The stone stayed the same. But the man grew tired. His back bent. His legs weakened. Everyone told him to put the stone down, but he refused. He said the stone was his, that he'd earned it, that no one else could carry it properly."

"What happened to him?"

"He died." Wil's voice was matter-of-fact. "Carrying the stone. His last words were that at least no one else had to bear the weight."

"That's a terrible story."

"It's a Cealdish story. We're not known for happy endings." He stopped walking, turned to face me. "The point is: some stones aren't meant to be carried alone. And insisting on carrying them yourself doesn't make you noble. It just makes you stubborn."

"This isn't a stone."

"No. It's whatever's happening with Denna. Whatever you saw that scared you. Whatever you think you have to fix by yourself." His eyes were steady. "Let us help."

I wanted to tell him. Wanted to explain about the Chandrian, about Master Ash, about the marks I'd seen on Denna's skin and the song she was being forced to sing. Wanted to share the weight, just as Fela had asked.

But some truths are too dangerous to speak. Some secrets, once shared, put others in danger.

"I'll think about it," I said.

"That's not a yes."

"No. But it's not a no, either." I started walking again. "Thank you, Wil. For caring enough to ask."

"That's what friends do." He fell into step beside me. "Even stubborn friends who insist on carrying their own stones."

---

I didn't sleep that night.

Instead, I sat by my window and watched the stars wheel overhead, and thought about what Wil had said. About stones and carrying. About help and stubborness.

And I thought about Sim and Fela, about the easy joy they'd found in each other, about what it looked like when love wasn't complicated by shadows and secrets.

Somewhere out there, Denna was sleeping. Or not sleeping. Or singing songs she didn't fully understand, weaving patterns that would open doors that should stay closed.

I couldn't save her alone. I knew that now.

But accepting help meant putting others in danger. Meant trusting them with truths that could get them killed.

The stone was heavy.

And I still didn't know how to put it down.

---

Morning came too quickly.

I found myself at the Eolian, sitting in my usual spot, my lute in my hands though I couldn't remember picking it up. The common room was nearly empty—too early for the regular crowd—and the silence felt almost sacred.

I played.

Nothing formal, nothing planned. Just notes rising and falling, melodies that came from somewhere deeper than thought. The music was sad and sweet and achingly beautiful, and I played until my fingers hurt and my eyes burned and the stone in my chest felt just a little bit lighter.

"That was lovely," someone said.

I looked up. A woman I didn't recognize stood near the stage, watching me with eyes that held something I couldn't quite read.

"Thank you."

"What was it called?"

I thought about it. About Sim and Fela and their easy happiness. About Wil and his Cealdish proverbs. About Denna, always Denna, dancing at the edge of disaster.

"I don't know," I said. "I don't think it has a name yet."

"The best songs usually don't. Not at first." She smiled. "Keep playing, young musician. The world needs more music like that."

She left.

And I stayed, and played, until the morning sun spilled through the windows and the first customers began to arrive, and another day began in the slow march toward whatever was coming.

But for those few hours—for that brief, precious time—the weight had been bearable.

And that was enough.
