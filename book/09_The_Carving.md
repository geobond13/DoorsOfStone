I SPENT THREE days in the Maer's library.

Not sleeping. Barely eating. Searching through every text I could find on Yllish magic, on written bindings, on the old ways of shaping reality through pattern and symbol.

Most of what I found was useless—children's rhymes and half-remembered legends. But occasionally, buried in the margins of older texts, I found fragments of the truth.

The Yllish masters hadn't just written stories. They had written *laws*. Patterns so fundamental that reality itself obeyed them. A knot properly constructed didn't just describe what should happen—it *commanded* it.

And the most powerful patterns weren't written on paper.

They were written on skin.

"You look terrible."

Bredon appeared in the library doorway, his walking stick tapping against the marble floor. He looked exactly as he had in the hidden chamber—calm, composed, ancient.

"I found something," I said. "In Quensten's *Fragments*. He mentions Yllish scribes who could bind behavior through inscription. Who could make a person do anything—say anything—feel anything—just by carving the right patterns into their flesh."

"Ah." Bredon moved to a nearby chair, settling into it with the careful grace of the very old. "You're beginning to understand."

"The beatings." My voice was hollow. "The Cthaeh said her patron beats her. Uses his walking stick. But it's not abuse, is it? It's—"

"Inscription. Yes." Bredon's face showed nothing. "Every bruise is a binding. Every mark is a word in a language older than Ergen. She's being *written*, Kvothe. Carved into a vessel for the song."

"How do you stop it?"

"You don't. Not easily." He leaned back, steepling his fingers. "The inscriptions become part of the person. Cut them out and you cut out pieces of the soul. Try to erase them and you erase the mind that holds them. The only way to remove Yllish bindings is to—"

"To what?"

"To make them irrelevant. To change what they command so fundamentally that the patterns no longer describe reality." He smiled, thin and humorless. "It's like asking how to unwrite a law. You can't just cross it out. You have to write a new law that supersedes it."

"Denna's song," I said slowly. "If I could stop the song before it's finished—"

"The song is almost finished. The inscriptions in her skin are nearly complete. In a few more days—perhaps a span—she'll be ready."

"Ready for what?"

Bredon didn't answer immediately. He stood, walked to the window, gazed out at the grey sky over Severen.

"Cinder is planning something," he said finally. "Something large. We don't know exactly what, but we know it involves the King. There's a grand event planned in Renere—a celebration of the King's engagement to the Jakis girl. Everyone who matters will be there."

"Ambrose's family."

"The same. They've been working toward this for years—positioning their daughter as the future queen, building alliances, eliminating rivals." He turned to look at me. "And Cinder has been using them. Manipulating them. Building toward a moment when all the pieces will be in one place."

"What pieces?"

"The King. The court. The binding that holds the Chandrian." Bredon's voice was very quiet. "And Denna. The vessel he's been preparing for years."

"He's going to use her to rewrite the binding at the celebration."

"He's going to use her to break Haliax's hold over the Seven. To seize control for himself." Bredon's eyes met mine. "And in the chaos that follows, when the binding shifts and power changes hands, the seals on the doors will crack. The things we've contained for three thousand years will begin to slip through."

"The Scrael."

"Just the beginning. The Scrael are scouts. Heralds. What follows them is much worse."

I thought of the howling in the darkness beyond the Waystone Inn. Of Bast's fear. Of a world beginning to come apart at the seams.

"How do I stop it?"

"That," Bredon said, "is what I was hoping you could tell me."

---

I found Denna two days later.

Not in Vintas—she'd moved again, following her patron's endless wanderings. But I'd learned her patterns over the years. Knew the kind of places she favored. And Bredon had resources I didn't—watchers and contacts in every city, tracking the movements of those who mattered.

She was in a small town at the edge of the Eld. Staying at an inn that catered to musicians and traveling performers. The kind of place she'd always loved.

The kind of place I might have found her before, if I'd been looking with the right eyes.

I arrived at dusk, when the light was soft and the shadows were long. The inn was quiet—too early for the evening crowd, too late for the travelers who'd moved on. I found her in a corner booth, alone, staring at a cup of something she wasn't drinking.

She looked up when I approached. And for a moment—just a moment—I saw something in her eyes that made my heart crack.

Relief. She was relieved to see me.

Then the mask came down, and she was Denna again. Guarded. Careful. Ready to run.

"Kvothe." Her voice was flat. "You shouldn't be here."

"Neither should you." I slid into the seat across from her. "I know about the inscriptions, Denna."

Her face went pale.

"I know what he's been doing to you. What you've been letting him do." I reached across the table, took her hand. Her skin was cool. Too cool. "Let me help you. Please."

"You can't help me." She didn't pull away, but she didn't grip back either. "It's too late for that."

"It's not. Bredon says—"

"Bredon." She laughed—a bitter, broken sound. "The old man who plays games within games. He told you about the Amyr, didn't he? About what they've been doing for three thousand years?"

"Yes."

"Did he tell you they're losing?" Her eyes met mine, and there was something fierce in them now. Something defiant. "Did he tell you the binding is already cracking? That what my patron is doing isn't starting the collapse—it's *controlling* it?"

I stared at her. "What do you mean?"

"The seals are failing. They've been failing for centuries—slowly, invisibly, but failing. The Amyr have been patching them, holding them together with spit and prayers. But it's not enough anymore." She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Something is coming, Kvothe. Something that's been building since before either of us was born. The only question is who controls it when it arrives."

"And you think Cinder is the answer?"

"I think Cinder is *an* answer. Maybe the only one." She pulled her hand back, reached up to touch the braids in her hair. "The inscriptions aren't chains. They're... armor. Protection. He's making me strong enough to survive what's coming."

"He's making you a weapon."

"Someone has to be." Her voice was very soft. "Someone has to be strong enough to hold the binding when Haliax falls. Someone has to keep the doors closed when everything else fails."

"And that's you? That's what you've chosen?"

"I didn't choose this." Tears gathered in her eyes—the first I'd ever seen her shed. "Do you think I wanted this? To be carved like a piece of wood? To feel my self being *overwritten* piece by piece until I don't know where I end and the song begins?"

"Then stop. Walk away. Come with me—"

"I can't." She gripped my hand suddenly, desperately. "The inscriptions won't let me. If I try to betray him—if I even *think* about betraying him—the patterns in my skin will..." She couldn't finish.

"Will what?"

"They'll close. Around my heart. Around my lungs. Around everything that keeps me alive." She was crying now, tears streaming down her face. "I'm not his student anymore, Kvothe. I'm his *prisoner*. And the only way out is through."

"Through what?"

"Through the song. Through the binding. Through whatever comes after." She wiped her eyes, her hand trembling. "He's promised me that once it's done—once the transfer is complete—the inscriptions will release me. I'll be free."

"And you believe him?"

She was silent.

"Denna—"

"I have to believe him." Her voice cracked. "Because if I don't—if this is all for nothing—then I'm already dead. I've been dead since the moment I let him write the first word on my skin."

I wanted to hold her. To tell her it would be alright. To promise that I'd find a way to save her, no matter what it cost.

But I couldn't. Because I didn't know if it was true. Because the thing looking out through her eyes wasn't entirely Denna anymore. Because the patterns in her skin were almost complete, and the woman I loved was drowning in a sea of magic older than the world.

"I'm going to stop him," I said instead. "Whatever it takes. I'm going to find Cinder and I'm going to tear down everything he's building."

"You'll die."

"Maybe."

"You'll make things worse."

"Maybe that too." I stood, looking down at her. "But I can't just watch. I can't just let him *have* you without a fight."

"That's not—" She stopped. Closed her eyes. When she opened them again, something had shifted in her expression. "Renere," she said quietly. "The celebration for the King's engagement. He'll be there. In disguise, probably, but he'll be there. That's when he's planning to..."

"To what?"

"To finish it. The song. The binding. Everything." She looked up at me, and for just a moment the mask slipped completely. I saw the girl beneath—frightened, desperate, trapped. "If you're going to stop him, that's when it has to happen. After that, there won't be anything left to stop."

"I'll be there."

"I know." She smiled—sad, broken, beautiful. "That's what scares me most."

---

"You found her."

The innkeeper's voice pulled me back to the Waystone. He was standing very still, his hands flat on the bar.

"I found her," he confirmed. "What was left of her. The patterns were nearly complete by then—I could see them sometimes, when the light hit her skin just right. Words I couldn't read. Commands I couldn't understand."

"But she told you about Renere."

"She gave me everything I needed to be in the right place at the right time." He laughed—bitter, hollow. "Which was exactly what Cinder wanted. She didn't know it, but the inscriptions... they compelled her. She couldn't betray him, but she could give me information that would lead me to him."

"He wanted you there."

"He wanted a witness. Someone to see his triumph. And who better than the boy who'd sworn to destroy him?" The innkeeper's hands curled into fists. "I was so focused on saving her that I didn't see the trap. Didn't understand that every step I took was part of his design."

"But you went anyway."

"Of course I went. I'm Kvothe the Bloodless. The man who fights what can't be fought and wins what can't be won." His voice was cold. "And I was about to prove that even the best of us can be the worst thing that ever happened."
