AURI FOUND ME in the Underthing.

Not where I usually met her—not by the apple tree or on the rooftops. She found me three levels down, in a place she called Cricklet, where the sound of running water echoed against stones so old they remembered the world before the University existed.

I hadn't been looking for her. I'd been looking for something else—a way to quiet my thoughts, to escape the weight of what I'd learned from Devi. The Archives held too many eyes. The Fishery held too many questions. But the Underthing...

The Underthing held Auri. And Auri never asked questions.

"You're too loud tonight," she said, appearing from a shadow I would have sworn was empty. Her moon-pale hair caught the faint light from my sympathy lamp. "Your thinking is too loud. It's making the pipes unhappy."

"I'm sorry." I didn't ask how she knew. Auri knew things. That was simply who she was.

"Come." She took my hand—her fingers cool and dry, surprisingly strong. "I want to show you something. Something that might help."

She led me deeper. Past Cricklet, past the Twelve, through passages I'd never seen despite my many visits. The Underthing was vast—I'd always known that—but tonight it felt infinite. A world beneath the world, full of secrets I'd barely begun to understand.

"Where are we going?"

"To the broken places," she said simply. "That's where the light gets in."

---

The room she brought me to was small and round, like the inside of an egg. The walls were covered in something that glittered—not gems, I realized as I looked closer, but fragments. Pieces of broken things: mirrors, glass, crystals, pottery. All of it arranged in patterns that seemed random until you stepped back and saw the larger picture.

A star. A tree. A door.

"This is where I come when I'm too loud," Auri said. She curled up on the floor, tucking her legs beneath her, looking perfectly at home amid the sharp edges and broken pieces. "The broken things understand. They remember what it was like to be whole, and they forgive me for not being whole anymore."

I sat across from her, careful not to disturb the patterns. "You're whole, Auri. You're one of the most complete people I know."

"That's kind. But it's not true." Her eyes met mine, and there was something in them—something ancient and aware that I rarely saw in her usual child-like demeanor. "I cracked, once. A long time ago. I put myself back together, but the pieces don't quite fit the way they used to. There are gaps. Spaces where things used to be."

"What things?"

"Names, mostly." She smiled, but it was a sad smile. "I used to have so many names. They made sense of the world, told me what things were and why they mattered. But then something happened, and the names... slipped. Now I have to give things new names. Make new sense of a world that doesn't quite work the way it used to."

I thought of Elodin. Of the story Wil had told me once—the brilliant student who'd cracked under the weight of too much knowledge, who'd broken through a wall with her bare hands and vanished into the places beneath the University.

"You were a student here," I said. "Before."

"I was many things before." She picked up a fragment of mirror, turned it so it caught the light from my lamp. "A princess. A student. A namer of considerable talent, according to some." She laughed—a sound like bells, but with a crack running through it. "I named something I shouldn't have. Looked too deep. Saw things that weren't meant to be seen."

"What things?"

"The shape of the world. The cracks in everything. The doors that everyone pretends don't exist." She set the mirror down, carefully, in its appointed place. "I saw what's behind them, Kvothe. Just a glimpse. Just for a moment. But it was enough."

"To break you?"

"To change me." She looked around the room, at all the broken pieces arranged so carefully. "Breaking isn't always bad. Sometimes things have to break before they can become something new. Something that fits better with what the world actually is, instead of what everyone pretends it is."

---

We sat in silence for a while. The broken things glittered around us, patient and forgiving.

"You're going to break soon," Auri said eventually. Not a question. Not a warning. Just a statement, simple and clear.

"What do you mean?"

"I can see it in you. The cracks are forming. The weight is too much." She reached out, touched my chest—just above my heart. "There's something inside you that doesn't fit. Something that's pushing against the walls, trying to get out."

I thought of the name of silence. Of the way it stirred in my sleeping mind, waiting.

"Is that bad?"

"It depends on what you do when it happens." She withdrew her hand, wrapped her arms around her knees. "When I broke, I ran. I hid. I made myself small and quiet and hoped the cracks would heal if I just stayed still long enough."

"Did they?"

"No." She smiled again—sad, knowing. "Cracks don't heal. They just become part of you. You learn to move around them, to let the light through in ways that don't hurt too much."

"What should I do instead?"

"I don't know. That's the terrible thing about breaking—everyone has to do it their own way." She stood, brushing dust from her ragged dress. "But I know one thing. When it happens, don't try to hold the pieces together. Don't pretend you're still whole when you're not. The pretending is what really kills you, in the end."

---

She led me back through the passages, up through the levels I knew, out into the moonlight by the apple tree.

"Here." She pressed something into my hand—a key, made of bone or ivory, carved in a shape I'd never seen before. "For when you need to open a door that has no door. For when you're trapped and there's no way out."

"Auri, I can't—"

"You can. You have to." Her eyes were very bright in the moonlight. "I made it for you. A long time ago. Before I knew you. Before I even knew I'd know you."

"That doesn't make sense."

"No." She laughed, and for a moment she was just Auri again—strange and sweet and full of impossible wisdom. "But the true things rarely do."

She kissed my cheek—quick, light—and then she was gone, vanished into the shadows like she'd never been there at all.

I stood alone in the moonlight, holding the bone key, feeling the weight of what she'd said settling into my chest.

Breaking isn't always bad. Sometimes things have to break before they can become something new.

I didn't understand, then. I wouldn't understand until Renere, until the moment I spoke the name of silence and felt everything I was shatter into a thousand pieces.

But the key stayed with me. The only door left, when all the other doors had closed.

---

"The key," Chronicler said. "That's how you opened the chest."

The innkeeper was quiet for a moment. The fire had burned low, and neither of them had moved to stoke it.

"Auri gave me many things," he said finally. "The key. The candle. A coin that never stopped spinning. But the most important thing she gave me was permission."

"Permission?"

"To break." He picked up the cloth—that eternal, useless cloth—and began to wipe the bar again. "Everyone else wanted me to be strong. To be clever. To be the hero who solved everything and never made mistakes. But Auri... she understood that strength isn't about never breaking. It's about what you do with the pieces afterward."

"What did you do with the pieces?"

"I'm still figuring that out." The cloth went still. "Some days I think I'm putting myself back together. Other days I think I'm just making a new shape out of what's left. And some days..."

He trailed off, looking at the door. At the night beyond.

"Some days I wonder if the pieces can ever be put back together at all. Or if I'll spend the rest of my life holding fragments, pretending they still fit."

"Do you think they will? Fit, I mean?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"Ask me when the story's over," he said. "If I'm still here to answer."
