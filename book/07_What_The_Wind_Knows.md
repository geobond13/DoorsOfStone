THE WIND CAME differently now.

Before the Fae, before Felurian, the name of the wind had been something I called in moments of crisis. A flash of power, unpredictable and brief. I could no more command it than command the sunrise.

But something had changed. The months among the Adem, the time in the Fae, the encounter with the Cthaeh—all of it had shifted something fundamental in how I perceived the world. The sleeping mind wasn't sleeping anymore. It was merely... resting. Waiting. Ready to wake at a thought.

Elodin noticed.

"You're holding it differently," he said, watching me from across the rooftop. The wind played through his hair, but he ignored it. "Before, you grasped at the wind like a child grabbing at butterflies. Now you're... what's the word? Conversing."

"Is that good?"

"It's unusual." He tilted his head, studying me. "Most namers take years to reach this stage. Some never do. They spend their whole lives wrestling with the sleeping mind, trying to force it awake."

"And me?"

"You." He smiled, but there was something troubled beneath it. "You've had it forced awake for you. By trauma. By the Fae. By speaking with an oracle that sees all possible futures." He paused. "I'm not sure that's good. I'm not sure it's bad. It simply *is*, and we have to work with what is."

"What do you want me to do?"

"Call the wind. Not in desperation, not in crisis. Just... call it. Calmly. Deliberately."

I closed my eyes. Reached inward, to the place where names lived. The sleeping mind wasn't exactly awake, but it wasn't exactly sleeping either. It was in that strange twilight between, where thoughts became feelings and feelings became knowing.

*Aerlevsedi.*

The wind answered. Not explosively—not the wild surge I was used to—but gently. A current of air that swirled around me, rustling my clothes, playing through my hair. It felt like a greeting. Like recognition.

"Good." Elodin's voice was soft. "Now let it go."

I released the name. The wind faded to natural breeze.

"Again."

I called it again. Held it longer this time. The wind grew stronger, then gentler, responding to my intention like an instrument responding to a practiced hand.

"Good. Now something harder." Elodin walked to the edge of the roof, looked out over the University. "Call the wind that passed this spot three days ago. The specific wind that touched this particular stone at that particular moment."

"Is that possible?"

"Everything is possible. The question is whether you can do it." He turned back to face me. "Names don't exist in isolation, Kvothe. The wind that blows now is connected to every wind that's ever blown. It carries memories, if you know how to listen. Echoes of everywhere it's been."

I closed my eyes again. Reached deeper this time. Not just for the wind, but for its history. Its path. The places it had touched and the things it had known.

For a long moment, there was nothing. Just darkness, and silence, and the ordinary feeling of air against my skin.

Then—

*Flash of green. A garden in the Fae, where flowers sang and shadows danced. The wind had passed through there, carrying the scent of impossible things.*

*Flash of grey. Mountains in the north, higher than any human had climbed. The wind had swept their peaks, cold and ancient and pure.*

*Flash of red. A campfire somewhere, people laughing, music playing. The wind had carried their joy across distances that should have been impossible.*

I opened my eyes.

"Three days ago," I said slowly, "this wind passed through the Fae. Through mountains in Ademre. Through a celebration somewhere near the border of Vintas."

Elodin's face was unreadable. "That's correct."

"How do you know?"

"Because I did the same exercise yesterday." He walked back toward me, his expression thoughtful. "What you just did—following the wind's history, reading its memories—that's not something most namers can do. Not without decades of practice."

"The Fae—"

"The Fae changed you. Yes." He stopped a few feet away, studying me like a puzzle he couldn't quite solve. "But there's something else. Something you're not telling me."

"What do you mean?"

"The wind carries memories. So do people." His eyes were very bright. "You have memories that don't belong to you. I can feel them, the way I can feel the Fae residue on your skin. Someone gave you something. Or took something. Or both."

I thought of the Cthaeh. Of its words, designed to cut.

"An oracle told me things," I said carefully. "Things about people I love. Things about people I want to kill."

"And now those words are part of you. Woven into your thinking. Shaping every choice you make." Elodin shook his head. "This is the Cthaeh's gift, Kvothe. Not information—*infection*. It doesn't need to control you directly. It just needs to give you the right truths at the right moment, and let your own nature do the rest."

"What am I supposed to do about it?"

"I don't know." He turned, began walking toward the ladder that led down from the roof. "But I know this: the wind doesn't lie. Neither do names. If you want to find truth—real truth, not the poison the Cthaeh gave you—learn to read the world the way you read the wind."

He paused at the ladder.

"Names leave traces. Actions leave echoes. Everything that's ever happened is still happening, somewhere, if you know how to look." He smiled, and it was sad. "Find the echoes of your parents' death. Find the traces of the people who killed them. And then—maybe—you'll understand why they had to die."

"Had to?"

"Had to." He climbed down the ladder, his voice floating back up. "In my experience, the universe rarely kills people by accident. There's always a reason. The question is whether the reason is good enough to forgive."

I stood alone on the rooftop, the wind swirling around me.

Find the echoes. Read the traces.

Somewhere, the truth of my parents' death was still resonating through the world. If I could learn to listen—really listen—maybe I could hear it.

And maybe, just maybe, I could understand.

The wind seemed to whisper as it passed. Not words, exactly. But something close.

Something that sounded almost like my mother's voice, singing a song I'd almost forgotten.

I closed my eyes and listened.

And for just a moment, I thought I understood what Elodin meant about names, and memories, and the echoes that never quite fade.
