THE WIND CAME differently now.

Before the Fae, before Felurian, the name of the wind had been something I grasped in crisis. A flash of power, unpredictable and brief. I could no more command it than I could command my own heartbeat.

But something had shifted. The sleeping mind wasn't sleeping anymore. It was resting. Waiting.

Elodin noticed.

"You're holding it differently," he said, watching me from across the rooftop. The wind played through his hair, but he ignored it. "Before, you grasped at the wind like a child grabbing at butterflies. Now you're... what's the word? Conversing."

"Is that good?"

"It's unusual." He tilted his head. "Most namers spend their whole lives wrestling with the sleeping mind. Trying to force it awake."

"And me?"

"You." The smile faded. "Yours was forced awake for you. By trauma. By the Fae. By speaking with something that shouldn't be spoken to." He looked away. "I don't know if that's good or bad. It simply is."

"What do you want me to do?"

"Call the wind. Not in desperation, not in crisis. Just... call it. Calmly. Deliberately."

I closed my eyes. Reached inward. The sleeping mind was in that strange twilight between waking and sleep, where thoughts become feelings and feelings become knowing.

*Aerlevsedi.*

The wind answered. Not the wild surge I was used to—just a current of air, swirling around me, playing through my hair. A greeting. Recognition.

"Good." Elodin's voice was soft. "Now let it go."

I released the name. The wind faded to natural breeze.

"Again."

I called it again. Held it longer this time. The wind grew stronger, then gentler, responding to my intention like an instrument responding to a practiced hand.

"Good. Now something harder." Elodin walked to the edge of the roof, looked out over the University. "Call the wind that passed this spot three days ago. The specific wind that touched this particular stone at that particular moment."

"Is that possible?"

"Everything is possible. The question is whether you can do it." He turned back to face me. "Names don't exist in isolation. The wind that blows now is connected to every wind that's ever blown. It carries memories." He paused. "Echoes of everywhere it's been."

I closed my eyes again. Reached deeper this time. Not just for the wind, but for its history. Its path. The places it had touched and the things it had known.

For a long moment, there was nothing. Just darkness, and silence, and the ordinary feeling of air against my skin.

Then—

*Green. A garden in the Fae where flowers sang. The wind had carried the scent of impossible things.*

*Grey. Mountains higher than any human had climbed. The wind had swept their peaks, cold and ancient.*

*Red. A campfire. Laughter. Music. Joy carried across distances that shouldn't exist.*

I opened my eyes.

"Three days ago," I said slowly, "this wind passed through the Fae. Through mountains in Ademre. Through a celebration somewhere near the border of Vintas."

Elodin's face was unreadable. "That's correct."

"How do you know?"

"Because I did the same exercise yesterday." He walked back toward me, his expression thoughtful. "What you just did—following the wind's history, reading its memories—that's not something most namers can do. Not without decades of practice."

"The Fae—"

"The Fae changed you. Yes." He stopped a few feet away, studying me like a puzzle he couldn't quite solve. "But there's something else. Something you're not telling me."

"What do you mean?"

"The wind carries memories. So do people." His eyes were very bright. "You have memories that don't belong to you. I can feel them. Someone gave you something. Or took something." He paused. "Or both."

I thought of the Cthaeh. Its words, designed to cut.

"An oracle told me things," I said carefully. "Things about people I love. People I want to kill."

"And now those words are part of you. Woven into your thinking." Elodin shook his head. "This is the Cthaeh's gift. Not information—*infection*. It doesn't need to control you. It just gives you the right truths at the right moment, and lets your own nature do the rest."

"What am I supposed to do about it?"

"I don't know." He turned, began walking toward the ladder that led down from the roof. "But I know this: the wind doesn't lie. Neither do names. If you want to find truth—real truth, not the poison the Cthaeh gave you—learn to read the world the way you read the wind."

He paused at the ladder.

"Names leave traces. Actions leave echoes. Everything that's ever happened is still happening, somewhere, if you know how to look." He smiled, and it was sad. "Find the echoes of your parents' death. Find the traces of the people who killed them. And then—maybe—you'll understand why they had to die."

"Had to?"

"Had to." His voice floated up from below. "The universe rarely kills people by accident. There's always a reason. The question is whether the reason is good enough to forgive."

I stood alone on the rooftop, wind swirling around me.

Find the echoes. Read the traces.

Somewhere, the truth of my parents' death was still resonating. If I could learn to listen—really listen—maybe I could hear it.

The wind whispered as it passed. Not words, exactly. But something close.

Something that sounded almost like my mother's voice.

I closed my eyes and listened.

And for just a moment, I understood.
