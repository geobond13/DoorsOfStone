THEY CAME FOR us on the third day.

We had been hiding in a farmhouse at the edge of the Eld—abandoned, half-ruined, the kind of place no one would think to look. But someone had thought to look. Someone always does.

"Soldiers," Fela said, her face pale at the window. "A dozen at least. Blue and white."

Alveron's colors. The Maer's colors. Soon to be the King's colors, once word spread of Roderic's death and the succession was confirmed.

"They're not here for supplies," Simmon said. He was already gathering our meager belongings. "They're searching systematically. Every farmhouse, every barn, every place a fugitive might hide."

"Then we run." Devi was on her feet, her hands already moving through the gestures of a prepared binding. "There's a back entrance through the root cellar. I scouted it yesterday."

"They'll have men circling the perimeter."

"Then we go through them." Her eyes met mine. "Kvothe. Can you...?"

She didn't finish the question.

Could I call the wind? Could I fight? Could I be anything other than the broken shell I'd become since Renere?

I didn't know.

"Go," I said. "All of you. I'll create a distraction."

"Don't be stupid—"

"The soldiers want me. The Kingkiller. If I draw their attention, you three can slip away."

"And what happens to you?"

I looked at my hands. At the fingers that wouldn't quite grip properly anymore. At the silence that lived behind my eyes, waiting.

"Maybe what should happen. Maybe what I deserve."

---

Simmon punched me.

It wasn't hard—Sim never could throw a proper punch—but it snapped my head to the side and left a sting across my jaw that felt almost welcome.

"Don't you dare," he said. His voice shook. "Don't you dare give up. Not after everything. Not after—"

"I killed a king, Sim. I killed Denna. I broke the world and called it saving."

"You saved the world. The doors are closed. The things on the other side are still locked away."

"And everyone who died in the process? The King? The nobles caught in the crossfire? Denna?" I shook my head. "The math doesn't add up. It never adds up."

"Then you make it add up." His hand gripped my shoulder. "You survive. You find a way to fix what's broken. You don't just... give up."

"Some things can't be fixed."

"Everything can be fixed. That's what you always told me." His eyes were wet. "Back at the University, when I was failing Sympathy, when I thought I'd never amount to anything—you told me that every problem has a solution. You just have to be clever enough to find it."

"I was wrong."

"You were right." He squeezed my shoulder. "Now prove it. Come with us. Keep running. Keep fighting. Not for yourself—for the people who still need you. For the friends who refuse to let you go."

The soldiers were at the front door now. I could hear their voices, their footsteps, the clank of armor and weapons.

"Please," Sim said. "Please don't make me watch you die."

---

We ran.

Not because I believed I deserved to escape. Not because I thought there was anything worth surviving for. But because Simmon asked me to. Because Devi grabbed my arm and pulled. Because Fela was already moving toward the root cellar, and the others were following, and staying behind would have meant leaving them to fight alone.

The cellar was damp and dark, the tunnel beyond it narrower than I'd expected. We crawled through earth and stone, roots brushing our faces, the smell of rot and decay filling our lungs.

Behind us, I heard shouts. The soldiers had found the farmhouse empty. They would search, find the cellar, follow the tunnel.

We needed to move faster.

"There's a stream ahead," Devi said, her voice muffled by the darkness. "We cross it, double back, lose them in the Eld."

"The Eld won't hide us forever."

"Nothing hides us forever. But it buys time." She crawled faster. "Time is all we have."

---

We emerged in a small ravine, the stream Devi had mentioned trickling past our feet. The water was cold—mountain runoff, carrying snowmelt from peaks I couldn't see. We waded through it, the current numbing our legs, the silence in me stirring at the sensation.

Cold. The silence liked cold.

I pushed the thought away and kept moving.

"Where do we go?" Fela asked, once we'd put enough distance between us and the farmhouse. "The University is out—they'll be watching it. Imre too. Anywhere we have connections is dangerous."

"Then we go somewhere we don't have connections," Devi said. "Somewhere no one knows us. Somewhere we can disappear."

"The Small Kingdoms," Simmon suggested. "A hundred little nations, half of them at war with the other half. Perfect place to get lost."

"Too far. We'd never make it past the border patrols."

"Atur, then. My father—"

"Is a Duke. You don't think the Maer has already sent word to the Aturan nobility?" Devi shook her head. "Your father would hand you over in a heartbeat if it meant avoiding a war."

"He wouldn't—"

"He would. Politics doesn't care about family, Sim. Not when kingdoms are at stake."

We walked in silence for a while. The trees grew thicker around us, the ancient oaks of the Eld rising like pillars holding up the sky. In their shadow, even the sunlight seemed muted.

"I know a place," I said finally.

They looked at me.

"Where?"

"An inn. At the edge of things, where the roads don't quite reach. A friend told me about it once." I didn't mention that the friend had been Skarpi, in a conversation I'd half-forgotten until now. "It's the kind of place people go to disappear."

"And you trust this friend?"

I thought about it. About Skarpi's stories. About the way he'd known my name before I told him. About the patterns I was only now beginning to see.

"No," I said. "But I don't have anywhere else to go."

---

The soldiers found us again at nightfall.

Different soldiers this time—not Vintish blue and white, but the grey and black of private mercenaries. Someone was paying for my head. Someone with resources the Maer might not have.

"Ambrose," I breathed.

"What?"

"The Jakis family. They were allied with Roderic through the engagement. When I killed the King, I killed their path to power."

"So now they want revenge."

"Or they want to be the ones who deliver the Kingkiller. Either way—" I gestured at the figures moving through the trees. "We have company."

There were more this time. Twenty, maybe thirty. Too many to fight. Too many to run from.

"I could create a binding," Devi said. "Something to slow them down."

"Against thirty men? You'd burn yourself out."

"Then you do something." Her eyes found mine in the darkness. "You have the silence. Use it."

"I can't control it."

"You controlled it well enough to kill a king."

The words hit like a slap.

"That was different. That was—"

"Desperation? Need? The moment demanding more than you thought you could give?" She stepped closer. "This is the same thing. They're coming to kill us, Kvothe. Kill us, or capture us, or drag us back to face whatever justice the powerful decide we deserve."

"Using the silence will make me worse. Will make me more... empty."

"Being dead will make you more empty." She grabbed my arm. "I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you to survive. We can figure out the rest later—but only if there IS a later."

The mercenaries were close now. Close enough that I could see their faces, their weapons, the cold efficiency of men who killed for money.

I looked at my friends.

At the people who had risked everything to stay with me.

At the future we might never have if I didn't act.

And I reached for the silence.

---

It came reluctantly.

Not like at Renere, when it had surged up from some deep well I didn't know I had. This time it resisted, as if it knew what I was planning and didn't approve. As if it was waiting for me to fall further before it would consent to be used.

But it came.

I felt it stir in my chest, spread through my limbs, fill my mouth with the taste of nothing. The night grew darker around us—not because the sun had set further, but because the silence was eating the light.

The first mercenary to reach us didn't even have time to scream.

The silence took his voice before it could form. Took his breath. Took the tiny sounds of his heartbeat and his blood flowing and his thoughts flickering behind his eyes.

He collapsed without a word.

The others hesitated.

I didn't.

---

Afterward, I stood in a clearing full of unconscious men.

Not dead—I had learned something since Renere. The silence could take more or less, depending on how I shaped it. These men had lost their sounds, their consciousness, their short-term memories. They would wake in a few hours with pounding headaches and no recollection of what had happened.

But they would wake.

"Kvothe." Simmon's voice was small. "What... what was that?"

"The silence." I looked at my hands. They were steady. For the first time in weeks, they were completely steady. "The name I spoke at Renere. It's... part of me now."

"You just dropped thirty men without touching them."

"Yes."

"You could have done that at the farmhouse. You could have done it when they first found us."

"I didn't know if I could control it." I met his eyes. "I still don't know. Every time I use it, I become less... something. Less human, maybe. Less myself."

"But you used it anyway. For us."

"For you." I started walking again, toward the deeper Eld, toward the place where roads didn't quite reach. "Now we need to move. Before they wake up. Before more come."

The others followed.

And the silence inside me settled back into waiting.

Patient.

Growing.
