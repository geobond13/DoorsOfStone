I READ THE book three times.

Each reading made the situation clearer—and more hopeless.

The alternative sealing ritual was possible. One person could close the doors permanently, if they met specific conditions. They needed to have touched all seven names, even briefly. They needed to be willing to give themselves completely. And they needed to perform the ritual at the exact moment of opening, when the energy was at its peak.

I had touched two names with certainty: wind and silence. I'd glimpsed others—fire in moments of rage, stone in the Underthing's deep places. But "touched" and "truly known" were different things.

"It's not enough," I said to Simmon and Wil. We were in my room at Anker's, the Lackless box on the table between us. "I don't know enough names. The ritual wouldn't work."

"Then we find another way," Wil said.

"There isn't another way. The seals are failing. The doors are opening. And the only alternative is—"

"Is finding seven Namers." Simmon leaned forward. "There have to be some left. The University has been training Namers for centuries."

"Training them badly. Elodin is the only Master who can truly name, and even he only knows a handful." I ran my hands through my hair. "The old Namers knew dozens of names. Hundreds. They could speak reality into whatever shape they wanted. We're... children playing with tools we don't understand."

"What about Fela?" Wil asked. "She knows stone."

"She knows stone. That's one."

"Elodin knows wind. That's two."

"Three, counting me." I shook my head. "We need seven. And we need them to be willing to participate in a ritual that might kill them."

"Might?"

"The book wasn't clear. The last time this ritual was performed was three thousand years ago. No one remembers what happened to the Namers involved."

Silence fell.

"We could ask," Simmon said finally. "Fela, Elodin, anyone else who might know a name. Explain what's happening. Let them choose."

"And if they say no?"

"Then we figure something else out." He met my eyes. "But we have to try, Kvothe. We can't just accept that the world is ending."

I found Fela in the Artificery.

She was working on a project—delicate metalwork, something beautiful and pointless. When I explained what I needed, her hands stopped moving.

"You want me to participate in a three-thousand-year-old ritual that might destroy me," she said flatly.

"I'm asking if you'd consider it."

"Consider." She set down her tools. "Kvothe, do you know how hard I worked to learn stone's name? How many years of study, how many failures, how many moments of despair before I finally heard it speak?"

"I know it wasn't easy."

"It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And you're asking me to risk losing that—losing myself—in a ritual no one understands." She shook her head. "I want to help. I truly do. But this..."

"I understand."

"Do you?" Her eyes were fierce. "You'd do it. You'd throw yourself into any fire if you thought it might work. That's who you are. But not everyone is built that way. Not everyone can sacrifice everything on the chance of success."

"I'm not asking you to be me."

"Yes you are." She turned back to her work. "You're asking me to think like you, to value what you value, to weight the scales the way you weight them. And I can't. I'm not brave enough, or stupid enough, or whatever it is that makes you the way you are."

"Fela—"

"Go." Her voice was quiet but firm. "Find someone else. Someone who doesn't have anything left to lose."

Elodin was more philosophical.

"You're asking the wrong question," he said. We were on the roof again, watching stars emerge from the darkening sky. "You're asking who will sacrifice themselves. You should be asking what sacrifice actually means."

"Death seems like a clear enough meaning."

"Does it?" He smiled. "Death is just change, Kvothe. A transition from one state to another. What makes sacrifice significant isn't the dying—it's the giving up. The letting go of everything you might have been."

"You're saying sacrifice doesn't require death."

"I'm saying death isn't the expensive part." He lay back on the tiles. "When I named the wind for the first time, I gave up part of myself. The person I was before couldn't exist alongside the person who knew wind's name. Something had to die."

"But you survived."

"My body survived. My mind survived. But the Elodin who didn't know the wind?" He shook his head. "Gone. Forever. Sacrificed so a new Elodin could exist."

"That's not the same as actually dying."

"Isn't it?" He sat up. "The ritual you're describing—it requires someone to 'give themselves completely.' What if that doesn't mean death? What if it means becoming something so different that the original person ceases to exist?"

"Like what?"

"Like the Chandrian." His voice was grave. "Lanre gave himself to the binding. Gave up his name, his face, his ability to die. He became Haliax—something that wasn't quite human anymore. That was a sacrifice, wasn't it?"

"He became a monster."

"He became what was needed to guard the doors. What if that's what the ritual requires? Not death, but transformation. Becoming something that can hold the seals forever."

I felt cold spread through me.

"You're saying I'd have to become like Haliax."

"I'm saying you should understand what you're agreeing to before you agree to it." Elodin's eyes met mine. "There are many ways to stop existing, Kvothe. Death is just the most obvious."

I returned to my room, more confused than when I left.

Denna was waiting for me.

"You talked to Elodin," she said.

"Yes."

"And he told you that the ritual might not mean death."

"He told me it might mean something worse." I sat heavily on the bed. "Becoming like the Chandrian. Giving up everything human to become a guardian forever."

"Would you do it?"

The question hung between us.

"I don't know," I admitted. "A month ago, I would have said yes without hesitation. Stopping the Chandrian, closing the doors, saving the world—it was all I wanted. All I cared about."

"And now?"

"Now I'm not sure what I want." I looked at her. "I thought revenge was the most important thing. But then I learned the truth—that the Chandrian aren't simple villains, that the Amyr aren't simple heroes, that everything I believed was more complicated than I understood."

"Does that change what needs to be done?"

"No. The doors still need to be closed. Cinder still needs to be stopped." I ran my hands through my hair. "But I'm not sure I'm the one who should do it. I'm not sure my reasons are pure enough."

"Kvothe." Denna sat beside me. "No one's reasons are pure. Everyone who's ever done anything important did it for mixed motives—love and hate and fear and pride, all tangled together."

"And if my pride is what dooms us?"

"Then it dooms us." She took my hand. "But I'd rather face doom with someone who's honest about their flaws than with someone who pretends to be perfect."

I looked at her—at the woman I'd loved from the first moment I saw her. At the bridge between worlds, the stolen name, the one who'd been used and broken and somehow survived.

"I don't want to lose you," I said.

"I don't want to lose you either." She smiled sadly. "But want doesn't change what is. The doors are opening. Someone has to close them. And if that someone has to give everything they are..."

"Then at least we should make it count."

"Yes." She leaned against me. "At least we should make it count."

That night, I made a decision.

I would go to Renere. I would face Cinder. I would try to stop the ritual, close the doors, save the world.

But I wouldn't sacrifice myself unless there was no other choice.

I would look for alternatives until the last possible moment. I would try every option, explore every possibility, exhaust every avenue before accepting that transformation was necessary.

And if, in the end, there was no other way...

Then I would become whatever was needed. Give up whatever was required.

Because some doors needed to stay closed. And some prices were worth paying.
