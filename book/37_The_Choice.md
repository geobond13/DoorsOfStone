DENNA'S EYES WERE clear.

For the first time since Cinder had taken her, for the first time since the binding had wrapped around her soul, she was fully present. Fully aware.

"I can see it," she whispered. "Everything. The flow. The channel. The way the energy wants to move."

"Can you stop it?"

"I can redirect it." She looked at me, and her eyes held something terrible. "But Kvothe—if I do—"

"Don't." Cinder's voice was sharp. "The transformation is almost complete. Another moment and—"

Denna turned toward him.

The energy flowing through her shifted. Instead of streaming into Cinder, it bent—curved—began flowing in a different direction entirely.

"No!" Cinder lunged toward her. "You can't—the channel is fixed—"

"The channel is me." Denna's voice was calm. "And I choose where the energy goes."

---

The great hall erupted into chaos.

The energy that had been flowing into Cinder scattered—some of it streamed back toward the opening doors, some of it dispersed into the air, and some of it...

Some of it flowed into Denna herself.

"What are you doing?" I shouted over the roar.

"What has to be done." She was glowing now, her body barely visible beneath the light streaming through her. "The energy needs somewhere to go. If it goes into Cinder, he becomes a god. If it disperses completely, reality tears apart."

"And if it goes into you?"

"Then I become the seal." She smiled—peaceful, resigned. "The door that holds everything back. Forever."

"Denna, no—"

"It's already happening." The light was growing brighter. "I can feel myself... changing. Becoming something else."

"There has to be another way!"

"There isn't. There never was." She reached toward me—not physically, but something else. A connection that transcended the physical. "This is what I was born for, Kvothe. What Ludis was always meant to be. The bridge becomes the barrier. The moon becomes the door."

"I won't let you—"

"You can't stop me." Her voice was fading, becoming something less than sound. "But you can help me. Speak my name again. Not to call me back—to send me forward. To complete what I've started."

"I don't know how."

"Yes you do. You've always known." She was barely visible now—just a shape of light, a suggestion of the woman I'd loved. "Speak my name. All of it. Everything I am and everything I'm becoming."

---

Cinder was screaming.

The energy that should have been his was flowing away—into Denna, into the seal, into the binding that was reforming around the opening doors. He tried to reclaim it, tried to redirect the flow, but Denna was stronger.

Because she wasn't fighting for power.

She was fighting for everyone.

I looked at the woman I loved.

At the sacrifice she was making.

At the choice I had to make in return.

"Ludis," I said.

And then I said more.

I spoke her name—not just the word, but the meaning. Everything she was. The wanderer who never stayed. The broken bridge between worlds. The woman who loved too much and trusted too little. The song that never quite found its ending.

I spoke the girl on the caravan, with her quick wit and her sharp eyes.

I spoke the woman in Imre, running from connection because connection meant pain.

I spoke the victim and the weapon and the sacrifice and the choice.

I spoke all of it.

And as I spoke, Denna transformed.

---

What emerged wasn't human.

It was light and shadow and stone and song, all woven together into something that had never existed before. The seal incarnate. The door made flesh.

And at the center of it, barely visible, was something that might have been Denna.

Or might have been something new.

"It's done," her voice said—not from her body, but from everywhere. From the walls, the floor, the air itself. "The channel is closed. The seal is restored. The doors will hold."

"Denna—"

"That's not my name anymore." The light was fading, sinking into the stones. "I'm the binding now. The lock. The thing that keeps everything separated."

"Can you come back?"

"No. This is permanent. This is what I am." A pause. "But Kvothe—I can still feel. Can still remember. Even as part of the seal, I'm still... something."

"How? How can you still be you if you're... everywhere?"

"Not everywhere. I exist at the nodes—the connection points where the binding touches something real. And one of those connections is you." Her voice grew fainter, like a dream fading at the edge of waking. "Your names are tangled with mine now. What you hear isn't my voice—it's impressions. Fragments of thought that your mind shapes into words. Like dreaming someone you love."

"Something good?"

"Something different." The voice was almost gone now, a whisper from the foundations of the world. "Take care of yourself. Don't let the guilt consume you. And remember—this was my choice. My sacrifice. Not yours."

The light faded completely.

The great hall went silent.

And Denna was gone.

---

Cinder was on his knees.

The transformation he'd spent three thousand years preparing for had failed. The energy he'd sought had been absorbed by Denna—by the new seal—and he was left with nothing.

"You ruined everything," he said. His voice was hollow. Broken. "Three thousand years. Three thousand years of planning, of sacrifice, of waiting—"

"You lost."

"No one won." He looked at me with eyes that held nothing but emptiness. "The doors are still sealed. The world is still broken. And your beloved is gone forever."

"She's not gone. She's everywhere."

"She's nothing. A pattern in stone. A binding without consciousness." He laughed bitterly. "You think she's still in there? Waiting for you? She was consumed, Kvothe. Destroyed. All that remains is the seal itself."

"You're wrong."

"Am I? How would you know? How could anyone know what happens to a soul when it merges with the binding?" He stood slowly. "The woman you loved is dead. The enemy you wanted to destroy is defeated. And you're left with nothing but the knowledge that you failed to save anyone who mattered."

I had no answer for that.

Because part of me feared he was right.

---

The other Chandrian were fading.

Without Cinder's ritual to sustain them, without the transformation to give them new purpose, they were simply... dissolving. Three thousand years of existence finally catching up with them.

"Finally," Haliax whispered. His darkness was thinning, revealing something almost human beneath. "Finally, finally, finally..."

One by one, they vanished.

Cyphus with a final flash of blue flame.

Stercus dissolving into shadow.

Pale Alenta sighing into silence.

And Haliax—Lanre—looking at me with eyes that held gratitude beneath the darkness.

"Thank you," he said. "For ending it. For breaking the cycle. For letting us finally rest."

Then he was gone too.

And I was left standing in the ruins of the great hall, surrounded by confused nobles and broken chandeliers, with nothing but memories and regret.

The doors were sealed.

The world was saved.

And Denna was gone.

Forever.
