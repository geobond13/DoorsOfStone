THE CHEST HAD three locks because there were three things inside.

Not physical things—not exactly. Echoes. Fragments. Pieces of who I'd been that couldn't be destroyed but couldn't be controlled. When I'd unmade Cinder, when I'd poured everything I was into that single act of absolute silencing, something had broken loose inside me. Powers that had been woven into my essence since childhood had torn free, become separate, become other.

I couldn't put them back. Couldn't absorb them again. Couldn't integrate them into whatever I was now.

So I built them a home instead.

The chest itself took three months to construct. Roah wood, harvested from a single ancient tree that had grown at the intersection of three ley lines—a place where reality was thin enough that the wood had absorbed qualities that ordinary timber could never possess. I worked it with tools I made myself, shaped it with techniques I remembered from the Lackless box, sealed it with binding that drew on the only power I still possessed.

The silence.

The same silence that had killed Denna. That had stopped the king's heart. That had unmade Cinder and sealed the doors and left me empty of everything except its endless, patient presence.

I used it to create locks that nothing could break.

---

The first lock held my music.

Not the ability to play—that was gone forever, burned out along with everything else. But the essence of music, the thing that had made my songs more than mere sound. The magic that had let me play fire into being, that had moved audiences to tears and joy, that had been the truest expression of who I was.

It had torn loose during the unmaking, this essence. Had become a separate thing, no longer part of me but not quite independent either. A fragment of power that retained the shape of what it had been but had lost the connection to the will that had once controlled it.

I could feel it sometimes, pressing against the lock. Wanting out. Wanting to be heard again.

The sensation was almost unbearable—like hearing your favorite song playing in another room, too muffled to make out the melody, too present to ignore. The music I had loved, the gift I had treasured, reduced to something caged and desperate.

But I couldn't let it free.

The silence had changed it, corrupted it. The same power that had given it form had also poisoned it. If I released it now, it wouldn't create—it would consume. Turn every sound it touched into nothing. The music that had once made people weep with joy would make them weep with the absence of everything, with the silence that dwelt at the heart of all sound.

So it stayed locked.

Waiting.

Pressing against its prison, singing songs no one could hear.

---

The second lock held my names.

Not just wind—all of them. Every name I'd ever touched, every identity I'd ever glimpsed behind the masks that reality wore. They were tangled together now, bound by the silence into something I couldn't separate.

Stone. Fire. Wind. Water. Iron. Blood.

And beneath them all, barely audible, woven into the fabric of the rest, Denna's name. Ludis. The name that had let me reach her across the void, that had connected us when everything else had been torn apart. The name that still linked us, even now, across the vast distance between what is and what was.

The names had been my greatest gift. The ability to see the truth behind things, to call to the essence that lay sleeping in everything that existed. For years I had chased this power, had burned myself trying to master it, had risked everything for moments of naming that most arcanists never achieved.

Now it was locked away, inaccessible, a treasure I could sense but never touch.

If I released the names, I might be able to use them again. Might regain the power I'd lost. Might become Kvothe once more, the namer, the singer, the legend that stories still whispered about.

But I might also destroy the connection to Denna. The names were so tangled, so intertwined—trying to extract one might sever others. Might cut the thread that let us speak across the binding. Might leave her truly alone, suspended in the seal with no voice reaching through to remind her that someone remembered.

The risk was too great.

Some powers aren't worth having if they cost the people we love.

So they stayed locked.

Waiting.

Whispering names I couldn't quite hear.

---

The third lock held something worse.

Not power. Not ability. Something darker.

The piece of Cinder I'd absorbed when I unmade him.

When you destroy something completely—when you erase it from existence with the name of silence—you don't just eliminate it. You pull it into yourself, through yourself, into the void where it ceases to be. And some of that passage... lingers.

His knowledge. His memories. His three thousand years of plotting and scheming. All of it lived inside me now, locked away because I couldn't bear to acknowledge it.

I had felt it, in the moment of unmaking. The rush of everything he was pouring through my awareness on its way to oblivion. Centuries of careful manipulation. Thousands of people used and discarded. The cold, calculated patience of a being who thought in decades instead of days.

And beneath all that, something even more disturbing: understanding.

I had seen, in that moment, why he had done what he'd done. The logic of it, the twisted reasoning that had led him from Chandrian guardian to would-be god. The despair that had driven him, the hope that had sustained him, the love—yes, love—that had been corrupted into something monstrous.

If I released it, I would understand things no human was meant to understand. Would know secrets that could reshape the world. Would see patterns that ordinary minds couldn't perceive, connections that stretched across centuries and continents.

But I would also become something more like him. Something that could calculate across millennia. Something that saw people as pieces on a board rather than lives with inherent worth.

The temptation was real.

Some days, I wanted to know what he knew. Wanted to understand why he'd done what he'd done. Wanted to see the patterns he'd seen, to finally comprehend the scope of the game that had consumed three thousand years.

But I remembered what he'd become. What he'd been willing to sacrifice for his goals. The bodies he'd left behind, the minds he'd broken, the love he'd twisted into a weapon.

So it stayed locked.

Waiting.

Whispering temptations I tried not to hear.

Bast asked about the chest again, years later.

We were in the common room, late evening, the fire burning low. The handful of customers who'd wandered in for dinner had long since left, and the silence of the Waystone had settled over us like a familiar blanket.

"You could open it," he said. Not demanding—just observing. "The locks aren't unbreakable."

"They're unbreakable by me."

"But not by everyone." He looked at the ceiling, where my room lay directly above us, where the chest sat humming quietly in its corner. "There are ways. Things I could try. Fae magics that don't rely on naming or sympathy."

"No."

"But Reshi, your power—"

"My power nearly destroyed everything. Did destroy the woman I loved." I set down the glass I'd been polishing. "The locks are there for a reason. The things inside are dangerous. Not just to me—to everyone."

"You don't know that for certain."

"I know what happened when I used those powers without proper control. I know what the silence did to the people around me when I spoke it without understanding what I was saying." I met his eyes. "The chest is a mercy, Bast. Not a prison. It's the only way I can ensure that what's inside never hurts anyone again."

"But you're wasting away. Fading. Without your abilities—"

"Without my abilities, I'm harmless. Safe. Unable to cause the kind of damage I used to cause." I touched the bar's surface, feeling the grain of the wood beneath my fingers. "That's not waste. That's wisdom."

"It's cowardice."

The word hung in the air.

I should have been angry. Should have defended myself, explained the careful reasoning that had led me to this choice, the weighing of risks and benefits that had convinced me the chest was necessary.

Instead, I just felt tired.

"Maybe," I said finally. "Maybe that's all I have left. The courage burned out of me in Cinder's mountain, along with everything else."

"I don't believe that."

"Then you believe a lie." I turned away, began stacking glasses. "The chest stays locked. The contents stay sealed. And I stay here, running an inn, waiting for... I don't know what I'm waiting for anymore."

"For her?"

The question stopped me.

"For her. For anything. For nothing." I resumed my work, not looking at him. "For the day when the waiting finally ends and I finally understand what all of this was for."

"And if that day never comes?"

"Then at least I'll have done no more harm. At least the things locked in that chest will never escape to hurt anyone else." I set the last glass in place. "Sometimes that's the best you can hope for. Not victory. Not redemption. Just the absence of further disaster."

Bast was quiet for a long moment.

"The Fae have a saying," he said finally. "In our language, it goes something like: 'The coward and the wise man often walk the same path. The difference is which one knows why they're walking.'"

"And which am I?"

"I don't know." He stood, stretched. "But I know you think about it. You question yourself. You wonder if you're making the right choice." He smiled slightly. "Cowards never wonder. They just run."

He left me alone with the silence and the night and the chest humming quietly overhead.

---

The chest sat in the corner of my room.

Every night, I looked at it before I closed my eyes. Every morning, I looked at it when I woke.

It was made of dark roah wood, polished to a shine that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. The iron bands that reinforced its corners had turned black with age, and the copper inlays that traced patterns across its surface had developed a patina of green and brown that made them look ancient, archaeological, recovered from some forgotten tomb.

The three locks were visible on the front: not keyholes, exactly, but depressions in the wood where something might fit. Something that wasn't a key. Something that didn't exist in the physical world.

I had designed them that way deliberately.

The first lock would open to the sound of true music—not mere notes, but the essence of music itself, the thing that made melody more than organized noise. Only someone who understood music the way I once had, who felt it in their bones and blood and breath, could produce the sound that lock required.

I couldn't anymore. The ability had been locked away in the chest itself, creating a paradox: the only thing that could open the lock was already inside.

The second lock would open to the speaking of a name. Not just any name—my name. My true name, the identity that lay beneath all the roles I'd played, all the masks I'd worn, all the versions of Kvothe that the stories had created. Only someone who knew me completely, who understood every layer of who I was, could speak that name.

I didn't know my own name anymore. The silence had obscured it, wrapped it in layers of emptiness until I couldn't remember what I was called in the deepest part of my soul.

The third lock would open to an act of love. Not romantic love, not friendly love, but something purer: the kind of love that expects nothing in return, that gives without hoping to receive, that sees another person clearly and values them anyway.

I had locked away my capacity for that kind of love along with everything else. The wound of Denna's loss, the guilt of the King's death, the weight of all the damage I had caused—they had calcified around my heart until I couldn't feel anything strongly enough to satisfy the lock's requirement.

Three locks. Three impossible keys.

Three doors between me and everything I'd lost.

---

Sometimes, late at night, I sat in front of the chest and talked to it.

Not to the chest itself—to what was inside. To the music that pressed against its prison. To the names that whispered in their tangle. To the fragment of Cinder that remembered things I was afraid to know.

"I'm sorry," I would say. "I'm sorry I couldn't find a better way. I'm sorry you're trapped in there. I'm sorry for all of it."

The chest would hum slightly louder in response. Not communication—just resonance. The things inside responding to my voice, to my presence, to the silence that connected us all.

"I tried to be the hero the stories needed," I would continue. "I tried to save everyone, to fix everything, to be Kvothe the Arcane and Kvothe the Bloodless and all the other names they gave me. But I wasn't good enough. Wasn't smart enough. Wasn't wise enough."

The music would press against its lock, aching to be free.

"And now I'm this. Whatever this is. A man running an inn, carrying silence, waiting for something I can't name."

The names would whisper, tangled and confused.

"Maybe someday I'll figure it out. Maybe someday I'll heal enough to open these locks, to reclaim what's inside, to become someone again instead of just existing."

Cinder's memories would stir, offering knowledge I didn't want.

"But not today. Not yet. Not until I'm sure I can control what's released."

The chest would settle, subsiding into its patient wait.

And I would go to bed, and dream of music and names and dark knowledge, and wake to another day of routine and silence and the slow, grinding weight of being no one at all.

---

A reminder.

That's what the chest was, in the end.

Of what I'd been.

Of what I'd given up.

Of what might still be waiting, locked inside, ready to be released if I ever found the courage—or the desperation—to try.

Three locks.

Three keys I didn't have.

Three doors between me and everything I'd lost.

And the silence holding them all closed.

Forever.

Or at least, that was the plan.

But plans, as I'd learned, have a way of changing.

And somewhere in the distance—in the binding that held the world together, in the seal that kept the doors closed, in the vast network of silence that connected everything to everything else—Denna stirred.

*The story isn't finished,* she whispered. *The chest won't stay closed forever.*

*How do you know?*

*Because nothing does. Because entropy is patient. Because the universe doesn't like locks.* Her voice was faint, barely audible, stretched thin across impossible distance. *And because I know you, Kvothe. I know you can't resist a mystery.*

*I'm not Kvothe anymore.*

*You'll always be Kvothe. No matter what name you use, no matter how much silence you carry.* A pause. *And someday—when you're ready—you'll remember that.*

*What if I'm never ready?*

*Then I'll wait.* Her voice was gentle, infinite, full of the patience that came from being woven into the fabric of reality itself. *I'm good at waiting. I learned from the best.*

The chest hummed.

The silence settled.

And I lay in the dark, thinking about locks and keys and the woman I loved who was everywhere and nowhere at once.

Waiting.

Always waiting.

For the day when the story would finally begin again.
