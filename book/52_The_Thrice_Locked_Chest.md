THE CHEST HAD three locks because there were three things inside.

Not physical things—not exactly. Fragments of who I'd been that couldn't be destroyed but couldn't be controlled. When I'd unmade Cinder, powers woven into my essence since childhood had torn free, become separate, become other.

I couldn't put them back. So I built them a home instead.

The chest took three months to construct. Roah wood from a tree that had grown at the intersection of three ley lines, shaped with techniques I remembered from the Lackless box, sealed with the only power I still possessed.

The silence. The same silence that had killed Denna. That had unmade Cinder and sealed the doors.

I used it to create locks that nothing could break.

---

The first lock held my music.

Not the ability to play—that was gone forever. But the essence of music, the magic that had let me play fire into being, that had been the truest expression of who I was.

It had torn loose during the unmaking. I could feel it sometimes, pressing against the lock—like hearing your favorite song playing in another room, too muffled to make out the melody, too present to ignore.

But I couldn't let it free. The silence had corrupted it. If released now, it wouldn't create—it would consume, turn every sound it touched into nothing.

So it stayed locked. Singing songs no one could hear.

---

The second lock held my names.

Not just wind—all of them. Stone. Fire. Wind. Water. Iron. Blood. They were tangled together now, bound by the silence into something I couldn't separate.

And beneath them all, woven into the fabric of the rest, Denna's name. Ludis. The name that still linked us across the vast distance between what is and what was.

If I released the names, I might become Kvothe once more. But I might also destroy the connection to Denna. The names were so tangled—trying to extract one might sever others. Might leave her truly alone.

Some powers aren't worth having if they cost the people we love.

So they stayed locked. Whispering names I couldn't quite hear.

---

The third lock held something worse.

The piece of Cinder I'd absorbed when I unmade him.

When you erase something from existence with the name of silence, you pull it through yourself into the void. And some of that passage lingers.

His knowledge. His memories. His three thousand years of plotting. All of it lived inside me now. I had felt it in the moment of unmaking—the rush of everything he was pouring through my awareness. And beneath it all, something disturbing: understanding. Why he had done what he'd done. The logic that had led him from guardian to monster.

If I released it, I would know secrets that could reshape the world. But I would become something more like him—something that saw people as pieces on a board.

The temptation was real. But I remembered what he'd become. What he'd sacrificed.

So it stayed locked. Whispering temptations I tried not to hear.

Bast asked about the chest again, years later.

We were in the common room, late evening. "You could open it," he said. "The locks aren't unbreakable."

"They're unbreakable by me."

"But not by everyone. There are ways. Fae magics that don't rely on naming or sympathy."

"No."

"But Reshi, your power—"

"My power destroyed the woman I loved." I set down the glass I'd been polishing. "The chest is a mercy, Bast. Not a prison."

"But you're wasting away. Without your abilities—"

"Without my abilities, I'm harmless. That's not waste. That's wisdom."

"It's cowardice."

The word hung in the air. I should have been angry. Instead, I just felt tired.

"Maybe. The courage burned out of me in Cinder's mountain."

"I don't believe that."

"The chest stays locked." I turned away. "And I stay here, waiting for... I don't know what anymore."

"For her?"

"For her. For anything. For nothing."

Bast was quiet, then: "The Fae have a saying. 'The coward and the wise man often walk the same path. The difference is which one knows why they're walking.'"

"And which am I?"

"I don't know. But cowards never wonder. They just run."

He left me alone with the silence and the chest humming quietly overhead.

---

The chest sat in the corner of my room. Dark roah wood, polished to a shine that absorbed light. Iron bands turned black with age, copper inlays green with patina. Three locks visible on the front: not keyholes, but depressions where something might fit. Something that didn't exist in the physical world.

The first lock would open to true understanding. Not knowledge—understanding. The kind that comes when someone has truly listened, heard not just the words but the silences between them. Because understanding is the first step of healing. You cannot mend what you will not see.

The second lock would open to love without expectation. The kind that stays without requiring. That sees someone at their worst and chooses them anyway—not because they might become better, but because they are enough as they are. Because love is the second step of healing. Understanding shows us the wound, but love lets us believe it's worth tending.

The third lock would open to accepted fear. Not conquered—acceptance is different from victory. The willingness to be afraid and act anyway. Because acceptance is the final step of healing.

But here was the crucial thing I only understood later: the locks were sequential. Love could not reach me until understanding cracked the first wall. Fear could not be accepted until love made acceptance feel possible. And none of it mattered if I wasn't ready to receive it.

Bast's love had been there for years—fierce, unconditional, waiting. But I had built walls so high that even love couldn't reach the lock it was meant to open. The locks don't respond to what's offered. They respond to what's received. And I had been refusing to receive anything at all.

Three locks. Three stages. Three things I could not give myself but had to receive from others.

Here was the truth I only understood years later: the locks weren't meant to keep things IN. They were meant to keep ME out. Until I was ready.

I had built a door that could only be opened by a version of myself that didn't exist yet. And then I had waited for him to arrive.

---

Sometimes, late at night, I sat in front of the chest and talked to it.

"I'm sorry," I would say. "I'm sorry I couldn't find a better way."

The chest would hum in response. Not communication—just resonance.

"I tried to be the hero the stories needed. But I wasn't good enough."

The music would press against its lock, aching to be free.

"Maybe someday I'll heal enough to open these locks. But not today. Not until I'm sure."

And I would go to bed, and dream of music and names and dark knowledge, and wake to another day of being no one at all.

---

Three locks. Three keys I didn't have. Three doors between me and everything I'd lost. The silence holding them all closed.

Forever. Or at least, that was the plan.

But plans have a way of changing.

And somewhere in the distance—in the binding that held the world together—Denna stirred.

*The chest won't stay closed forever,* she whispered. *Because the universe doesn't like locks. And because I know you, Kvothe. You can't resist a mystery.*

*I'm not Kvothe anymore.*

*You'll always be Kvothe.* A pause. *And someday—when you're ready—you'll remember that.*

*What if I'm never ready?*

*Then I'll wait. I'm good at waiting. I learned from the best.*

The chest hummed. The silence settled.

And I lay in the dark, waiting for the day when the story would finally begin again.
