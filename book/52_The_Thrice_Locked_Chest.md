THE CHEST HAD three locks because there were three things inside.

Not physical things—not exactly. Echoes. Fragments. Pieces of who I'd been that couldn't be destroyed but couldn't be controlled.

The first lock held my music.

Not the ability to play—that was gone forever. But the essence of music, the thing that had made my songs more than mere sound. The magic that had let me play fire into being, that had moved audiences to tears and joy, that had been the truest expression of who I was.

I could feel it sometimes, pressing against the lock. Wanting out. Wanting to be heard again.

But I couldn't let it free. The silence had changed it, corrupted it. If I released it now, it wouldn't create—it would consume. Turn every sound it touched into nothing.

So it stayed locked.

Waiting.

The second lock held my names.

Not just wind—all of them. Every name I'd ever touched, every identity I'd ever shaped. They were tangled together now, bound by the silence into something I couldn't separate.

Stone. Fire. Wind. Silence itself.

And beneath them all, barely audible, Denna's name. Ludis. The name that had let me reach her across the void. The name that still connected us.

If I released the names, I might be able to use them again. Might regain the power I'd lost.

But I might also destroy the connection to Denna. Might sever the thread that let us speak across the binding.

The risk was too great.

So they stayed locked.

Waiting.

The third lock held something worse.

Not power. Not ability. Something darker.

The piece of Cinder I'd absorbed when I unmade him.

His knowledge. His memories. His three thousand years of plotting and scheming. All of it lived inside me now, locked away because I couldn't bear to acknowledge it.

If I released it, I would understand things no human was meant to understand. Would know secrets that could reshape the world.

But I would also become something more like him. Something that could calculate across centuries. Something that saw people as pieces on a board.

The temptation was real.

Some days, I wanted to know what he knew. Wanted to understand why he'd done what he'd done. Wanted to see the patterns he'd seen.

But I remembered what he'd become. What he'd been willing to sacrifice for his goals.

So it stayed locked.

Waiting.

Bast asked about the chest again, years later.

"You could open it," he said. "The locks aren't unbreakable."

"They're unbreakable by me."

"But not by everyone." He looked at the chest with something like hunger. "There are ways. Things I could try—"

"No."

"But Reshi, your power—"

"My power nearly destroyed everything. Did destroy the woman I loved." I touched the roah wood. "The locks are there for a reason. The things inside are dangerous. Not just to me—to everyone."

"But you're wasting away. Fading. Without your abilities—"

"Without my abilities, I'm harmless. Safe. Unable to cause the kind of damage I used to cause." I met his eyes. "That's not waste, Bast. That's wisdom."

"It's cowardice."

The word hung in the air.

"Maybe," I said finally. "Maybe that's all I have left. The courage burned out of me in Cinder's mountain, along with everything else."

"I don't believe that."

"Then you believe a lie." I turned away. "The chest stays locked. The contents stay sealed. And I stay here, running an inn, waiting for... I don't know what I'm waiting for anymore."

"For her?"

"For anything. For nothing." I began wiping the bar. "For the day when the waiting finally ends."

The chest sat in the corner of my room.

Every night, I looked at it before I closed my eyes. Every morning, I looked at it when I woke.

A reminder.

Of what I'd been.

Of what I'd given up.

Of what might still be waiting, locked inside, ready to be released if I ever found the courage—or the desperation—to try.

Three locks.

Three keys I didn't have.

Three doors between me and everything I'd lost.

And the silence holding them all closed.

Forever.

Or at least, that was the plan.

But plans, as I'd learned, have a way of changing.
