THE UNIVERSITY APPEARED on the seventh day.

I'd expected it to look different—changed by everything that had happened. But the stone towers were the same. The courtyard was the same. The students moving between buildings were the same.

The world had almost ended, and here, nothing had changed.

"It looks so normal," Simmon said, echoing my thoughts.

"What did you expect?"

"I don't know. Something. A sign that the world almost ended." He shook his head. "But everything just... goes on. Like nothing happened."

"That's how it works." Devi's voice was matter-of-fact. "The world almost ends, and then it doesn't, and everyone goes back to their lives. Only the people at the center know what was at stake."

"And we carry that forever."

"We carry it as long as we choose to." She looked at me. "The weight isn't mandatory, Kvothe. You can set it down whenever you're ready."

"I'm not ready."

"I know. But someday you will be."

Wil met us at the gates.

He looked tired—the kind of tired that comes from weeks of vigilance, of watching for threats that never materialized. But when he saw us, his face lit up.

"You're alive," he said. "I wasn't sure—the reports coming from Renere were confused—"

"We're alive." I gripped his shoulder. "Most of us."

His face fell. "Denna?"

"She saved everyone. Became the seal. She's..." I couldn't find the words. "Gone."

"Not gone." Wil's voice was gentle. "Part of everything. Everywhere at once." He met my eyes. "That's what Auri said. That the moon-named woman had become the binding."

"Auri knew?"

"She felt it happen. Said the Underthing sang differently afterward. Calmer." He hesitated. "She also said to tell you that Denna isn't suffering. That being everywhere isn't the same as being nowhere."

I didn't know what to do with that.

So I just nodded, and we walked into the University together.

The days that followed were strange.

I went through the motions—attending classes, eating meals, talking to friends—but none of it felt real. I was present without being present. Alive without really living.

"It's shock," Simmon said, one evening in the Taps. "Post-traumatic stress. I've read about it."

"I'm not stressed."

"No, you're numb. Which is a kind of stress response." He pushed a mug of cider toward me. "Give it time. Eventually the numbness will fade and you'll feel things again."

"What if I don't want to feel things again?"

"Then you'll be miserable forever." His voice was gentle. "But you won't choose that. You're not built for numbness, Kvothe. You're built for passion—for feeling things so strongly that they burn."

"That's what got Denna killed."

"That's what made you try to save the world." He met my eyes. "Passion isn't the problem. It's what you do with it that matters."

Elodin found me on the Horns.

He sat beside me without speaking, watching the sunset paint the sky in colors that shouldn't exist.

"You touched the silence," he said finally.

"I spoke her name."

"More than that. When you completed her transformation, you touched what she became. The seal itself. The silence at the heart of everything." He looked at me. "That leaves a mark."

"What kind of mark?"

"The kind that changes what you are. What you can do. What you can become." He paused. "You know the name of silence now. Not just the name—the thing itself. It lives inside you."

"I don't feel any different."

"You will. When the numbness fades. When you try to use your abilities again." He stood. "Be careful, Kvothe. Naming was already dangerous for you. Now it's more so. The silence you touched—it's not just absence. It's hunger. It consumes."

"Consumes what?"

"Everything that makes noise. Sound. Speech. Music." He began walking away. "You gave Denna the words that transformed her. Those words came from somewhere inside you. And the place they came from isn't empty anymore. It's full of silence."

I watched him go.

Then I looked at my hands.

The same hands that had played music since childhood.

The same hands that had shaped words into magic.

Were they still mine?

Or had they become something else?

I found out the next day.

I was in my room at Anker's, holding my lute for the first time since Renere. The strings were dusty, the wood warm from the sunlight.

I positioned my fingers. Drew a breath. Began to play.

Nothing happened.

Not silence—I could still make the strings vibrate. But the music that had always flowed through me, the effortless melody that had been my gift since childhood...

It wasn't there anymore.

I tried again. And again. Simpler pieces, easier patterns.

Nothing worked.

The music was gone.

In its place, there was only silence.

And the silence was hungry.
