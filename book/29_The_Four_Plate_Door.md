THE DOOR HAD changed.

I'd passed the four-plate door hundreds of times over the years—that massive slab of grey stone with its copper plates, its impossible absence of any visible mechanism. I'd wondered about it, dreamed about it, researched it obsessively.

But I'd never seen it like this.

The copper plates were glowing. Not with heat—with something else. A light that seemed to come from inside the metal, pulsing in slow rhythms that matched no pattern I recognized.

"It started three days ago," Lorren said.

He was out of the Medica now, bandaged and weak but on his feet. His eyes, as he looked at the door, held something I'd never seen from him before: fear.

"When?"

"The night of the fire. When the restricted stacks burned." His voice was hoarse. "The archives felt it. This place... it's connected to what's behind there, Kvothe. More connected than I ever understood."

"What's behind there?"

"I don't know. No one alive knows." He touched the door—just barely, fingertips on stone. "But I feel it now. Pressing. Wanting out."

The door pulsed. The copper plates flared.

And for just a moment, I heard something from the other side.

Not words. Not sound exactly. More like the memory of silence—the echo of something that had stopped speaking so long ago that even the absence of its voice had faded.

But now it was waking up.

"We can't leave it like this," I said.

We were in Lorren's office—what remained of it after the fire. The walls were smoke-stained. The books that had survived were stacked in careful piles, waiting to be evaluated.

"We can't do anything about it." Lorren sat heavily behind his desk. "The four-plate door was sealed by the founders of this University. By Namers whose abilities make Elodin look like a child playing with letters. Whatever knowledge they used, it's been lost for centuries."

"Then we find it."

"Where? The Archives held everything that survived from that era. And most of that is ash now." His eyes met mine. "The fire wasn't random, Kvothe. It targeted specific sections. Specific texts. Whoever set it knew exactly what to burn."

"Denna. Or rather, Cinder working through her."

"Is there a difference?"

"Yes." My voice was harder than I intended. "She's free now. The binding is broken."

"Is it?" Lorren's gaze was steady. "People don't just shake off three thousand years of magic because someone speaks their name. If Cinder controlled her once, he can do it again. She's a weapon, Kvothe. And weapons can be picked up by anyone with the will to use them."

"She's not a weapon."

"She's a bridge between worlds. A key to doors that should stay closed." His voice was gentle but firm. "I don't say this to hurt you. I say it because you need to understand what we're dealing with. Sentiment won't save us. Only clear thinking will."

I found Elodin on the Horns.

He was sitting on the edge, legs dangling over the drop, watching the four-plate door through one of the Archives' windows.

"You can see it from here," he said, without turning. "The pulsing. It's gotten brighter since yesterday."

"What does it mean?"

"It means the seals are failing faster than anyone expected." He looked at me. "Your song—the counter-song you've been spreading—it helped. Slowed the conceptual seal's decay. But it wasn't enough. Too little, too late."

"Then what do we do?"

"We? There is no 'we' anymore." His voice was distant. "This is your story now, Kvothe. Your choice. Your sacrifice."

"I thought you said sacrifice might not mean death."

"I said it might mean something worse." He stood, still looking at the door below. "The founders who sealed this door—they didn't just use naming. They used themselves. Wove their own essences into the binding. Became part of the seal."

"They're still in there?"

"Parts of them. The parts that knew the names they needed. The parts that were willing to give themselves for the binding." He turned to face me. "That's what the ritual requires. Not death—dissolution. Breaking yourself into pieces and using those pieces to hold the door closed."

"How is that different from what the Chandrian are?"

"It isn't." His eyes were sad. "The Chandrian are the first guards—the ones who volunteered before anyone understood what they were volunteering for. They're not monsters, Kvothe. They're martyrs. Martyrs who've had three thousand years to regret their choice."

I returned to my room at Anker's.

Denna was waiting. Simmon and Wil too. They looked at me with expressions I couldn't read.

"We're leaving for Renere," I said. "Tomorrow."

"The door—" Simmon started.

"The door is connected to everything. If we can stop what's happening at Renere—stop Cinder's ritual—then maybe the seals will hold. Maybe the door will stop pulsing. Maybe we'll have time to find another solution."

"And if we can't?"

"Then nothing else matters anyway." I sat on my bed, suddenly exhausted. "The doors are opening everywhere. The four-plate door, the Lackless door, the seven doors that Bredon told me about. If Cinder's ritual succeeds, they all open at once. And whatever's behind them..."

"Comes through," Denna said quietly.

"Comes through." I looked at her. "You know what he's planning. The specifics. Can you draw me a map? Show me where the ritual will happen, what resources he'll have, what we might be able to use against him?"

"I can try." She sat beside me. "But Kvothe—Cinder knows everything I know. If the binding breaking alerted him—"

"Then he knows we're coming. Yes." I smiled grimly. "But he expected that. He's been expecting me since the Cthaeh spoke to me. I'm supposed to be there. I'm supposed to interfere."

"Then why go?"

"Because not going doesn't help. If I stay here, the doors still open. If I go, at least I might learn something. Might find an opportunity he didn't anticipate."

"Or you might play right into his hands."

"I've been playing into his hands for years. At least this time, I'll know I'm doing it."

That night, I took the Lackless box to Auri.

"Keep it hidden," I said. "Somewhere no one can find it. Somewhere even Cinder's fragments can't reach."

"I will." She cradled the box like something precious. "But Kvothe—these things inside. The ring, the key, the stone. They want to be together. They want to be used."

"I know."

"If you need them..." She looked up at me. "If everything else fails and you need what's inside, I can bring them. I can find you, wherever you are."

"How?"

"The Underthing has doors too. Not the big ones, not the sealed ones. Small doors. Quick paths." She smiled mysteriously. "I can walk between places when I need to. It's one of the things I learned when I broke."

"Auri..."

"Don't be sad." She touched my hand. "Everyone breaks eventually. The important thing is what you become afterward." She tucked the box into her robes. "I'll keep your keys safe. And when you need them—when the moment comes—I'll be there."

"I don't want you in danger."

"There's no place that isn't dangerous now." She began walking into the darkness. "The doors are opening everywhere. The only safety is behind them. And the only way behind them..."

"Is through."

"Yes." Her voice echoed from the shadows. "Through the fire and the silence and the breaking. Through everything that has to end before something new can begin."

She was gone before I could respond.

I stood alone in the Underthing's darkness.

Above me, the University hummed with the energy of the failing seal. Below me, older things stirred in their ancient sleep. And somewhere ahead of me, the road to Renere waited.

I thought of everyone I was leaving behind. Fela, who'd refused to join me. Lorren, who'd sacrificed himself trying to save what couldn't be saved. Elodin, who'd given me warnings I still didn't fully understand.

I thought of everyone I was bringing with me. Denna, freed but fragile. Simmon and Wil, loyal beyond reason. Devi, who'd joined us at the last moment, her eyes bright with something between fear and excitement.

And I thought of myself. The boy who'd lost everything in a fire. The man who'd traveled across the world seeking revenge. The Namer who'd touched the silence and somehow survived.

Who would I be when this was over?

Would I be anything at all?

I climbed back toward the light, leaving the darkness to keep its secrets a little longer.

Tomorrow, we would begin the journey that ended everything.

Tomorrow, we would walk toward the breaking.
