THE PATTERN ON the floor wasn't just glowing. It was breathing.

With each pulse, the light grew brighter. The tiles beneath my feet trembled. And through the stone, through the binding that had held for three millennia, I could feel something pressing. Something old and vast and desperately hungry.

"It's beautiful," Cinder said. He stood in the center of the pattern, arms raised like a conductor before an orchestra. "Three thousand years of waiting, and finally—finally—"

"Stop."

My voice cut through the humming of the seal. Cinder turned, amusement in his empty eyes.

"You can't stop it, Kvothe. The doors are opening with or without my intervention. I'm just... directing the flow."

"Without the key, you can't complete the transformation."

"Without the key, the transformation will be messier. Less controlled. But it will still happen." He smiled. "Did you think hiding the Lackless box would change anything? The box is a convenience, not a necessity. I've had centuries to find alternatives."

He reached into his coat and withdrew something small. Something that gleamed with ancient light.

A ring of dark iron.

"You stole—"

"I had it made. A replica, containing fragments of the original." He slid the ring onto his finger. "The physical component of the seal. One of three."

"The key—"

"Is still necessary. But not the whole key." He produced something else—a sliver of tarnished silver. "A piece of the original. Enough to make the binding work."

I felt cold spread through me.

"And the stone?"

"That's where you come in." His smile widened. "You didn't think I was just going to let you walk into my ritual unexamined, did you?"

Guards emerged from the crowd.

They weren't dressed as guards—they wore the same formal attire as the other nobles. But their movements were wrong. Too coordinated. Too precise.

"Chandrian," I breathed.

"My family." Cinder's voice held something that might have been affection. "Broken, bound, waiting for release. They've served their purpose for so long. Tonight, they finally get what they've been waiting for."

"Freedom?"

"Ending." His eyes were distant. "They want to stop existing. Three thousand years of guardian duty has worn them to nothing. All they want is to finally rest."

"And you're giving them that?"

"I'm giving them transformation. When I become what I'm meant to become, I'll absorb their essence. Their power. Their knowledge." He looked at them almost tenderly. "They'll become part of something greater. Part of me."

The guards—the Chandrian—moved to surround us. I saw faces I recognized from legends. Cyphus, with blue flame dancing at his fingertips. Stercus, shadows coiling around him like snakes. Pale Alenta, her presence making the air itself sick.

And Haliax.

He stood apart from the others, watching with eyes that held nothing but darkness. The leader of the Chandrian. The man who had destroyed cities in the name of love.

"This wasn't the plan," Haliax said. His voice was hollow—the echo of something that had once been human. "You said you would open the doors. Free what's behind them. You said nothing about absorbing us."

"Plans change." Cinder's voice was casual. "You've had three thousand years to find your beloved Lyra. You've failed. Now it's time for a new approach."

"You would betray your own family?"

"I would do what's necessary. What's always been necessary." Cinder turned to face him. "You're tired, Haliax. We're all tired. Let me end it. Let me take your burden and transform it into something that can actually make a difference."

For a moment, I thought Haliax might attack. The darkness around him deepened, coiled, prepared to strike.

Then it faded.

"Do what you will," he said. "I'm done fighting. Done hoping. Done pretending that anything matters."

Denna screamed.

Not a scream of fear—a scream of power. The channel was activating, pulling energy through her whether she wanted it or not.

I ran toward her.

"Kvothe, no—"

Guards moved to intercept me. I called the wind without thinking, sent two of them tumbling. Called it again, cleared a path.

The pattern on the floor was blazing now, so bright it was hard to look at. And in its center, energy was flowing—visible streamers of power, flowing from the edges of reality toward the center.

Toward Denna.

Toward Cinder.

"Break it!" Simmon shouted from somewhere. He was fighting too—I could hear the sounds of chaos, of magic being thrown around. "Whatever you're going to do, do it now!"

I reached Denna.

She was suspended above the floor, energy streaming through her like water through a pipe. Her eyes were open but unseeing, her mouth moving in words I couldn't hear.

"Denna!"

"She can't hear you." Cinder appeared beside me. "She's the channel now. Fully activated. All the energy from the opening doors is flowing through her, into me."

"Then I'll stop the flow."

"How? By killing her? By destroying the bridge?" He laughed. "Go ahead. Try. See what happens when you disrupt a flow this powerful."

I looked at Denna.

At the energy coursing through her.

At the transformation that was slowly, inevitably turning Cinder into something beyond human.

I had one chance.

One option.

One name that might change everything.

"Ludis," I said.

Her true name. Spoken with everything I had.

And Denna opened her eyes.
