AURI LED US through paths that shouldn't have existed.

The Eld was ancient, yes, and full of hidden ways—but the routes she chose weren't merely hidden. They were impossible. Paths that curved back on themselves. Clearings that opened onto different forests entirely. Streams that flowed uphill, their water silver in the moonlight.

"The between-places," Auri explained, when I asked. "The seams where the worlds don't quite fit together. Most people can't see them. Most people walk right past."

"But you can see them."

"I can feel them." She touched a tree as we passed, and the bark rippled like water. "The Underthing is like this, in places. Broken and bent and beautiful."

"You came all this way to find me?"

"I came because you needed finding." She looked back at me, her moon-bright eyes serious. "You've been lost for a long time, Kvothe. Even before Renere. Even before the oath. You just didn't know it."

"And now?"

"Now you know." She smiled. "That's the first step to being found."

We traveled for three days through the between-places.

Time moved strangely there—sometimes racing forward, sometimes crawling to a halt. I lost track of the hours, the meals, the moments of rest. The silence inside me grew quieter in those passages, as if even it was uncertain what to make of the spaces we moved through.

My friends stayed close. Simmon walked beside me, his presence steady and warm. Fela and Devi followed, alert for dangers that never quite materialized. We were a small band of refugees, fleeing through the cracks in reality, seeking a place that might not exist.

And then, on the third day, the between-places ended.

We stepped through a curtain of willow branches and found ourselves in a small village.

---

Newarre was nothing special.

A cluster of houses around a crossroads. A general store. A wheelwright's shop. An old stone church. The kind of place that existed in every corner of the Four Corners—unremarkable, forgettable, the sort of village people passed through without remembering.

But at the heart of it stood an inn.

The Waystone.

It was built of old stone and dark timber, its windows glowing with warm light in the gathering dusk. A sign hung above the door—a simple stone with a hole through the center, painted grey and silver.

"This is it," Auri said. "This is where you need to be."

"It's just an inn."

"It's not." She let go of my hand. "Can't you feel it? The weight of the place? The way the world bends around it?"

I looked again. And this time, I saw what she meant.

The inn was ordinary on the surface. But beneath the surface—in the same layer where naming happened, where the sleeping mind perceived truth—it was something else entirely. A knot in reality. A place where stories gathered and time moved sideways. A waystone in truth as well as name.

"Who built this?" I asked.

"Someone who needed a place to disappear. Someone who understood that the best hiding places aren't invisible—they're unremarkable." Auri touched the stone of the wall. "It's been waiting for you. For a long time."

"How long?"

"Long enough." She turned to face me. "This is where I leave you."

"What? Auri, you can't—"

"I have to go back. The Underthing needs me. The broken things need mending." She smiled. "But you'll be safe here. As safe as you can be, anyway."

"I don't know how to run an inn."

"You'll learn." She took my hand one last time—my broken left hand, the one that was slowly dying. "Listen to me, Kvothe. What's happening to you—the breaking, the losing—it's not punishment. It's transformation."

"That's what you said before."

"Because it's true." Her grip tightened. "You've spent your whole life being someone. Now you have to learn to be no one. That's what this place is for. That's what the waiting is for."

"Waiting for what?"

"For the silence to teach you." Her eyes were full of tears. "For the breaking to finish. For the moment when you remember how to be whole again."

She stood on her tiptoes and kissed my cheek.

"Be safe," she whispered. "Be patient. Be nobody for a while."

Then she turned and walked back toward the willow curtain.

Back toward the between-places.

Back toward a life I would never share again.

---

I watched her go until she vanished.

Then I turned back to the inn.

"So," Simmon said, after a long moment. "What now?"

"Now?" I looked at my friends—the people who had followed me through hell and come out the other side. "Now we rest. We hide. We figure out who we are in a world that wants us dead."

"You make it sound so appealing."

"It's not meant to be appealing." I started toward the inn's door. "It's meant to be survival."

---

The inn was empty.

Not abandoned—maintained, clean, waiting. But empty of people, empty of noise, empty of everything except dust motes drifting in lamplight and the smell of old wood and older secrets.

"Someone's been keeping this place up," Devi said, running a finger along a perfectly polished bar. "But there's no one here."

"There was a caretaker." A voice, familiar and strange, echoed from the shadows. "But he died last winter. Been waiting for someone to take over."

A man stepped into the light.

He was old—impossibly old, with a face like weathered leather and eyes that had seen too much. He wore simple clothes, traveler's clothes, and he carried himself with the quiet confidence of someone who had nothing left to prove.

"Skarpi," I said.

"Hello, Kvothe." He smiled—that knowing, irritating smile I remembered from Tarbean. "You're late."

"You were expecting me?"

"I've been expecting you for years. Ever since I told you that story in the tavern." He walked to the bar, settled onto a stool with a sigh. "Knew you'd end up here eventually. Just didn't know when."

"You set this up?"

"I prepared a hiding place for a friend who was going to need one." He shrugged. "The Amyr look after their own. Even the ones who've made a mess of things."

"I'm not Amyr."

"Aren't you?" His eyes were sharp. "You've spent your life hunting the Chandrian. Seeking justice. Trying to do what's right even when it costs everything. Sounds like Amyr to me."

"The Amyr were destroyed centuries ago."

"The organization was. But the purpose?" He shook his head. "That can't be destroyed. It just goes underground. Changes form. Waits for someone worthy to take it up again."

I didn't know what to say.

"The inn is yours," Skarpi continued. "If you want it. A place to hide, to heal, to wait. There's power in the stones—protection woven in by people who knew what they were doing. As long as you stay here, the world can't find you."

"And if I don't want it?"

"Then leave. Walk away. Go back to running, fighting, breaking yourself against the rocks of your own pride." He stood. "But I think you're tired of running, Kvothe. I think you've been tired for a long time."

---

My friends gathered around me.

Simmon, loyal and brave. Fela, wise and steadfast. Devi, sharp and dangerous. They had followed me through everything. They deserved better than a life of hiding in a forgotten inn.

"You should go," I said. "All of you. Find new lives. Forget you ever knew me."

"Don't be stupid," Sim said.

"I'm serious. The Maer will hunt me forever. Ambrose will send assassins. Everyone who stays with me becomes a target."

"We've been targets since we helped you in Renere," Fela said. "That ship has sailed."

"Then sail somewhere else. The Small Kingdoms. The Tahl. Anywhere that isn't here."

"And leave you alone?" Devi shook her head. "You'd fall apart in a week."

"I'm already falling apart."

"Then we'll hold you together." Sim put his hand on my shoulder. "That's what friends do, Kvothe. We've been through too much to walk away now."

"This isn't your burden."

"No. It's ours. All of ours." He looked at the others. "We decided that when we followed you out of Renere. We're not changing our minds now."

I looked at their faces. Saw the determination. The loyalty. The love that I didn't deserve but was given anyway.

"You're all idiots," I said.

"Probably," Sim agreed. "But we're your idiots."

---

They stayed for a month.

Helped me learn the inn. Helped me clean the rooms and stock the cellar and remember how to smile at strangers. Helped me build the mask I would wear for years to come.

Then, one by one, they left.

Fela first—back to the University, where she could watch for news and send warning if anything changed. Then Devi—to Atur, where her contacts could keep an eye on the political landscape. Finally Sim—to his father's estate, to try to salvage something from the wreckage of his family's reputation.

"I'll come back," he said, the day he left. "As often as I can."

"Don't. It's too dangerous."

"I don't care about dangerous." He hugged me—hard, fierce, the embrace of a brother rather than a friend. "Take care of yourself, Kvothe. Try to remember who you are."

"I'm not Kvothe anymore," I said. "That name is too famous. Too hunted."

"Then who are you?"

I thought about it. About the silence inside me. About the pieces that were falling away. About the man I was becoming in the space where the man I'd been used to be.

"Kote," I said. "I'm Kote now."

"What does that mean?"

"Disaster." I smiled—a thin, tired expression. "In Siaru. It means disaster."

He didn't laugh.

"It also means disaster already happened," I said. "Past tense. Something that's over. Something that can't hurt anyone anymore."

"Is that what you want to be? Something that's over?"

"I don't know what I want to be." I looked at the inn around me. At the prison I'd chosen. "But for now, I'll be Kote. The innkeeper. The man who used to be someone else."

Simmon left that afternoon.

And I was alone with the silence.

And the waiting.

And the slow, terrible process of learning to be no one.

---

Bast came later.

Sent by someone—Felurian, perhaps, or the Cthaeh's enemies, or simply the strange currents that moved through the Fae. He arrived one night with a smile and a story and a desperate desire to save someone who didn't want to be saved.

But that's a different tale.

For now, the story pauses here.

At the Waystone Inn.

Where a man named Kote waits behind a bar, polishing it with a clean white cloth.

Where the silence gathers.

Where the waiting continues.

And where, somewhere beneath all the masks, a spark of Kvothe still burns.

Waiting.
