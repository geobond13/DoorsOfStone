I TRAVELED ALONE.

Not because I wanted to—Simmon and Wil insisted on coming. But I wouldn't let them. This wasn't their fight anymore. It had never really been their fight. They'd just been caught in the wreckage of something they didn't understand.

"You'll die," Simmon said, when I refused his offer.

"Probably."

"Then why go alone?"

"Because if I die alone, you survive. If you come with me, Cinder kills you first just to make me watch." I gripped his shoulder. "Stay here. Keep the University safe. And if I don't come back—"

"What?"

"Remember me as I was. Not as what I'm becoming."

The journey took two weeks.

The same roads I'd traveled before, the same villages touched by silence. But now I saw them differently. Saw the patterns Cinder had woven. The trap he'd been building for months.

Each town was a node. Each cluster of silence was connected to the others. And at the center of the web—the mountain sanctuary where he waited.

"You understand now," a voice said, on my twelfth night out.

I didn't turn. I knew who it was.

"Bredon. Or should I say, Amyr?"

"I haven't been Amyr for years. Not since Renere." He moved to sit beside my fire. He looked older than before—more fragile. "We failed, Kvothe. The organization that survived for three thousand years—finished in a single night."

"Cinder's doing?"

"Partially. But also ours. We'd been weakening for centuries. What happened in Renere just exposed how hollow we'd become." He looked at the flames. "I came to warn you. What you're walking into—"

"Is a trap. I know."

"More than a trap. He's using the silence he's been cultivating. Using the connection between you and the seal." Bredon's voice was grave. "When you reach him, he's going to try to absorb you. Take the silence you carry and add it to his own."

"Why would that help him?"

"Because your silence is connected to Denna. To the seal itself. If he controls your silence, he controls the thread that links you to her." Bredon met my eyes. "He's not trying to open the doors anymore, Kvothe. He's trying to become the doors. To absorb the seal entirely and become the binding itself."

"That's not possible."

"Neither was speaking the name of silence. Neither was becoming what you've become." Bredon stood. "Be careful. And if you see an opportunity to end him permanently—take it. Whatever the cost."

He walked into the darkness.

And I sat by the fire, considering what he'd said.

The sanctuary was different when I arrived.

The patterns on the walls had spread—no longer contained within the carved chambers, but growing across the mountain's surface like living things. The silence here was absolute. Not just the absence of sound, but the absence of everything.

And at the center of it all, Cinder waited.

"You came," he said. "I wasn't certain you would."

"You threatened everyone I care about."

"I demonstrated what I could do. There's a difference." He moved through the patterned chamber like a ghost. "The old Amyr came to warn you, didn't they? Told you I'm trying to become the binding itself?"

"Are you?"

"I'm trying to transcend. Same as I've always been trying." He stopped, faced me. "The transformation at Renere failed because of Denna. But Denna is now part of the seal. If I can reach her through you—if I can use the connection you've maintained—"

"You'll absorb her. Become what she became."

"Become something greater. The seal incarnate. The door that never opens and never closes." His eyes burned with ancient hunger. "You can't stop me, Kvothe. The silence you carry is already mine. Has been since you walked into my sanctuary months ago."

I felt it then—the pull he was describing. The way my silence yearned toward his. The connection that had been growing without my knowledge.

"You've been preparing this from the beginning."

"I've been preparing this for centuries. You were just the final piece." He extended his hand. "Give me what you carry. Let me absorb the connection. And in exchange—"

"In exchange for what?"

"Freedom. Real freedom, not the half-life you've been living." His voice softened. "The silence is destroying you. You know it is. Every day, more of who you were is consumed. Eventually, there won't be anything left."

"And becoming part of you is better?"

"Becoming part of something larger is always better than fading into nothing." He stepped closer. "You could see Denna again. Really see her. Be with her in the binding itself."

I felt the temptation.

The same temptation I'd felt in this place before.

The promise of peace. Of ending. Of finally letting go.

But I'd made my choice months ago. And I wasn't going to change it now.

"No," I said.

"No?"

"I won't give you what you want. Not willingly." I reached for the silence inside me—not fighting it, not fleeing, just holding. "You'll have to take it."

Cinder smiled.

"Very well," he said. "If that's how you want it."

And the mountain came alive.
