ANKER'S HADN'T CHANGED.

The same scarred tables. The same watered-down ale. The same crowd of students arguing about sympathy and naming and the relative virtues of various masters. It was comforting, in a way—a fixed point in a world that kept shifting beneath my feet.

Sim and Wilem were already there when I arrived, sitting in our usual corner. Sim saw me first, his face breaking into a grin that hadn't changed since I'd left. Wilem was more reserved, but his nod carried the weight of months of worry finally easing.

"You look terrible," Sim said as I sat down. "What happened to your hair?"

"A story for another time." I signaled for a drink. "What happened here while I was gone?"

They exchanged a look—the kind of look that meant they were deciding how much to tell me.

"Ambrose happened," Wilem said finally. His voice was flat, controlled. "His father bought another seat on the Baron's Bench. He's practically untouchable now."

"He was already untouchable."

"More untouchable, then." Sim's grin had faded. "He's been making life difficult for anyone he thinks was your friend. Not directly—he's too clever for that. But through channels. Whispers. Pressure on the right people."

"What kind of pressure?"

Another exchange of looks.

"Wilem's stipend was cut," Sim said quietly. "Some confusion about paperwork. He's been working double shifts in the Fishery to make up the difference."

I looked at Wilem. He shrugged, but I could see the exhaustion in him—the weight of too many hours and too little sleep.

"And you?"

"My father received a very interesting letter about my academic performance." Sim's voice was carefully light. "Apparently I've been 'associating with unsuitable elements.' There was talk of cutting off my support entirely."

"Sim—"

"It's fine. I talked him down. Reminded him that I'm third in my class and that 'unsuitable elements' have a way of becoming influential figures." He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "The point is, Kvothe—things have gotten complicated. Ambrose isn't just after you anymore. He's after everyone connected to you."

---

The drinks came. I stared into my ale, watching the bubbles rise and pop.

"I should leave," I said. "Go somewhere else. If being connected to me is causing problems—"

"Don't be an idiot." Wilem's voice was sharp. "We knew what we were getting into when we became your friends. Ambrose is a snake, but snakes can be handled."

"Besides," Sim added, "where would you go? The Arcanum is the only place in the world that teaches what you need to learn. You can't just walk away from that."

"I might have to." I thought of Devi's warnings. Of Elodin's cryptic hints. Of the secrets I was beginning to uncover. "There are things happening, Sim. Things I can't explain yet. Things that make Ambrose look like a minor inconvenience."

"The Chandrian?" Sim's voice dropped to a whisper. "I thought that was just—"

"Not just. Never just." I looked around the room, making sure no one was listening. "The Chandrian are real. They killed my parents. And now I'm mixed up in something that goes back three thousand years, and I don't know if I'm a player or a piece, and there are people who want to kill me for asking the wrong questions."

Silence. Wilem and Sim stared at me, their faces pale in the tavern light.

"Okay," Sim said finally. "That's... a lot."

"I know."

"Like, significantly more than 'Ambrose is being mean' a lot."

"I know."

Wilem leaned forward, his dark eyes intent. "What do you need from us?"

I hadn't expected that. I'd expected arguments. Questions. Concerns about my sanity.

"I don't—"

"You're our friend," Wilem said, as if explaining something obvious. "You're in trouble. What do you need?"

---

I told them what I could.

Not everything—there were things I couldn't explain, things I didn't understand myself. But I told them about Denna's patron. About the Amyr and the pruned Archives. About the warning signs I was beginning to see, the patterns forming in the shadows.

They listened. They asked questions. And when I was done, they didn't tell me I was crazy.

"The Archives," Sim said thoughtfully. "I've noticed gaps before. Whole sections that should exist, based on the indexing system, but don't."

"You have?"

"I'm a Re'lar in Rhetoric and Logic. Pattern recognition is kind of my thing." He drummed his fingers on the table. "I never thought much of it—assumed it was just poor cataloging. But if someone is actively removing books..."

"That would explain the inconsistencies in the cross-references," Wilem added. "I've found citations to texts that don't exist. Books referencing other books that have no entry in the system."

"How many?"

"Dozens. Maybe hundreds." Wilem's expression was grim. "Someone has been very thorough. Very patient. This isn't casual censorship—this is systematic erasure."

I thought of Lorren. Of his warning about doors that only opened one way. Of the possibility that the Master Archivist was part of something much larger than I'd imagined.

"Can you help me look? Without getting caught?"

"Probably not without getting caught." Sim grinned—and this time it reached his eyes. "But since when has that stopped us?"

---

We stayed at Anker's until the candles guttered, making plans. Sim would approach the problem from a logical angle—mapping the gaps, looking for patterns in what had been removed. Wilem would work from a different direction, using his connections in the Fishery to access records that might have been overlooked.

And me? I would keep doing what I'd always done. Asking dangerous questions. Kicking over rocks to see what crawled out. Making enemies of people who would rather stay hidden.

"There's one more thing," Sim said as we were getting ready to leave. "Something that's been bothering me."

"Just one thing?"

"The girl. Denna." He met my eyes, and there was something serious in his face. "I've seen her around. While you were gone. She's been asking about you."

My chest tightened. "What kind of questions?"

"The worried kind, at first. Then the resigned kind. Then..." He hesitated. "The last time I saw her, she wasn't asking about you at all. She was just watching. Sitting in the corner of the Eolian, watching people play, not singing herself. Looking like someone who was waiting for something."

"Something or someone?"

"I don't know. But Kvothe—whatever you're caught up in, I think she's caught up in it too. And I'm not sure she knows how to get out."

I nodded. I didn't trust myself to speak.

"Just... be careful with her," Sim said. "I know you care about her. We all do. But sometimes caring isn't enough. Sometimes you have to know when to step back."

"I don't know how to step back."

"I know." Sim put his hand on my shoulder. "That's what worries us."

---

"They knew," Chronicler said. "Your friends. They knew something was wrong with Denna."

"Everyone knew something was wrong with Denna." The innkeeper's voice was weary. "The question was never about knowing. It was about doing something with that knowledge."

"And you didn't do anything?"

"I did everything I could think of. I asked questions. I offered help. I tried to get her away from her patron." He laughed, bitter. "But Denna was her own person. She made her own choices. And in the end, all my clever plans and good intentions didn't change a thing."

"So what was the point? Of the friends, the investigations, the plans?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"The point," he said finally, "was that I wasn't alone. Even when I was making all the wrong decisions, even when I was stumbling toward a disaster I couldn't see—I had people who cared about me. Who tried to help, even when they didn't understand."

"Did that make it better? In the end?"

"No." He picked up his cloth again. "But it made it bearable. And sometimes that's all you can ask for."
