THE AMYR'S SECRET library was beneath the palace itself.

Ironic, really. The very building where Cinder would perform his ritual held the knowledge that might stop him. But the Amyr had always believed in hiding in plain sight.

"The founders built this chamber when the palace was constructed," the old Amyr—his name was Manet, I'd learned—explained as he led us through passages that shouldn't exist. "They knew that someday, someone might try what Cinder is attempting. So they prepared."

"Prepared how?"

"Counter-measures. Alternatives. Ways to mitigate the damage if the main seals failed." He stopped at a door that looked no different from the stone around it. "This is the heart of their work. The culmination of centuries of research."

He spoke a word I didn't recognize.

The door opened.

The library was smaller than I expected.

Perhaps a dozen shelves. A few hundred books. But the quality of the texts made up for the quantity—these weren't copies or translations. These were originals, written in hands that had been dead for millennia.

"Take what you need," Manet said. "Learn what you can. You have until dawn."

"Why dawn?"

"Because that's when the preparations for the ball begin. After that, the palace will be locked down. No one in or out without invitation." He turned to leave. "I hope you find what you're looking for."

"What if we don't?"

He paused at the door.

"Then you'll have to improvise. That's what you're good at, isn't it?"

We divided the books between us.

Simmon took the historical texts—accounts of the original sealing, descriptions of the Namers who had created it. Devi focused on the technical documents—diagrams of the seal's structure, explanations of how the components interacted. Fela examined the physical artifacts—small objects that had been gathered alongside the books, each one labeled with symbols I couldn't read.

Denna and I took the most dangerous texts.

The ones that described what was behind the doors.

"They called them the Shapers," Denna said, reading from a volume so old its pages crumbled at her touch. "The ones who made the Faen realm. The ones who believed reality was clay to be molded."

"What happened to them?"

"Most died in the war. The survivors were... changed. Broken. Made into something that could be bound." She looked up. "The Chandrian weren't the only ones sealed behind the doors, Kvothe. They were just the guardians. The things they guard..."

"Are the Shapers."

"What remains of them. Twisted by three thousand years of isolation. Mad with the need to reshape what they can no longer touch." Her voice dropped. "If the doors open fully, they come through. All of them. And they won't stop until the world is remade in their image."

"What does that mean?"

"I don't know. The texts become unclear. Metaphorical." She closed the book. "But I do know this: the binding that created the Chandrian—the same binding Elodin described—it wasn't just about guarding the doors. It was about absorbing part of the Shapers' essence. Making the guards immune to what they were guarding."

"Immune how?"

"The Chandrian can't be changed. Can't be reshaped. Whatever the Shapers try to do to them, it doesn't work." She met my eyes. "That's why they've survived so long. That's why Cinder has been able to plan his transformation despite being bound to the doors."

"But Cinder wants to become a Shaper."

"Cinder wants to become something new. Something that combines the Shaper's power with the Chandrian's immunity." Her voice was grim. "If he succeeds, he'll be able to reshape reality while being immune to anyone else doing the same to him."

"A god."

"Worse than a god. A god can be denied. A god needs worship. What Cinder wants to become..." She shook her head. "He'll remake the world on a whim. Nothing will stop him."

I found what I was looking for near dawn.

It was a small text—barely a pamphlet—written in a hand that seemed to waver between languages. The title translated roughly as "The Alternative Sacrifice."

*When all other options have failed,* it read, *when the seals cannot hold and the guardians cannot guard, one possibility remains. A willing soul may choose to become the new seal. To take the binding into themselves. To transform into something that holds the doors closed through sheer force of will.*

*This sacrifice is not death. It is something both greater and lesser. The soul that chooses this path gives up everything that makes them who they are. Their memories, their loves, their hopes for the future—all of it is consumed by the binding.*

*What remains is not the person who made the sacrifice. It is the seal itself. A living lock. A conscious door that chooses, moment by moment, to stay closed.*

*The sacrifice cannot be undone. The soul that becomes the seal cannot be retrieved. They exist forever in a state between life and death, awareness and oblivion.*

*But they save everything else.*

I read the passage three times.

Then I set the book aside and sat in silence.

"You found something."

Denna sat beside me.

"Yes."

"Is it what you hoped for?"

"It's what I expected." I looked at my hands. "Someone has to become the seal. Give up everything to hold the doors closed."

"You."

"Maybe. Or you. Or someone we haven't met yet." I met her eyes. "The text says the sacrifice has to be willing. Truly willing. Not coerced, not manipulated—they have to choose it with full understanding of what they're giving up."

"Can anyone make that choice?"

"I don't know. I don't know if I can." I stood, walked to the window. "When I started this—when I was a boy burning for revenge—I would have said yes without hesitation. But now..."

"Now you have things to lose."

"Now I understand what I'd be losing. Not just my life. My self. Everything I am, everything I might become—all of it consumed by the binding."

"Is that worse than letting the world end?"

"I don't know." I turned to face her. "Is anything worse than letting the world end?"

She didn't have an answer.

Neither did I.

We emerged from the library at dawn.

The palace was waking around us—servants preparing for the ball, nobles arriving from distant estates, the whole machinery of celebration grinding into motion.

None of them knew what was coming.

None of them suspected that in two days, the world they knew might cease to exist.

"We have what we need," I told the others. "Information, at least. Understanding."

"And a solution?"

"A possibility. Nothing more." I looked at each of them in turn. "The ball is in two days. We need to be inside when the ritual begins. We need to be close enough to act when the moment comes."

"Act how?"

"I don't know yet. But whatever happens, we have to be there. In the great hall. At the center of everything."

"Cinder will expect that."

"Cinder expects everything. The question is whether we can surprise him anyway."

I looked toward the palace—toward the great hall where the sealing had been performed three thousand years ago. Where the doors had been closed. Where everything was about to change.

"Two days," I said. "In two days, we either find a way to save the world, or we watch it end."

It wasn't a plan.

It was all we had.
