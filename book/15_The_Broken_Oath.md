AURI LED ME through the dark.

Not the darkness of night—something deeper. The Underthing had passages that went beyond the University, connecting to older things. Older places. The bones of a world that had existed before the Creation War.

I don't remember most of the journey. I was broken in ways that didn't show on the outside—mind cracked, heart shattered, soul fragmenting with every step. I held onto Auri's hand like it was the only thing keeping me from dissolving into the dark.

She didn't speak. She just walked, sure-footed in passages I couldn't see, leading me toward something she understood and I couldn't imagine.

Eventually, we surfaced.

The world had changed.

Not dramatically—not in the ways you'd notice at first glance. The sun still rose. The wind still blew. People still went about their lives, eating and sleeping and loving and dying. But there was something different in the air. A wrongness. A tension.

The binding was cracked. Haliax had told me that. The doors were leaking. And the things that seeped through were just the beginning.

I saw Scrael tracks on a road near Tarbean. Found a village empty—not destroyed, just *abandoned*, the people fled from something they couldn't name. Heard stories in inns of shadows that walked like men, of voices in the dark, of nightmares that didn't end when you woke up.

The war was beginning. The war that I had started.

Bast found me three weeks later.

I was in a nameless town at the edge of the Eld, drinking in an inn that smelled of stale beer and despair. I'd stopped running by then—not because I'd found somewhere safe, but because I'd stopped caring where I went.

He walked through the door like he owned the place. Dark hair, sharp features, eyes that glittered with something inhuman. He looked at me, at the empty bottles on my table, at the hollowness in my face.

"You're pathetic," he said.

"Go away."

"No." He sat down across from me, uninvited. "Felurian sent me. She said you were drowning, and she wanted to know if I could pull you out."

"Felurian." The name felt strange in my mouth. Like something from another life. "How does she know where I am?"

"She knows everything that happens in twilight." Bast smiled—but there was worry beneath it. Genuine concern. "She says you're supposed to be doing something. Something important. But you're just sitting here, drinking yourself to death."

"I killed her."

"I know."

"I killed the King."

"I know that too." He leaned forward. "And I know what you're going to do. What you're *supposed* to do. The question is whether you're going to do it, or whether you're going to sit here until the darkness catches up with you."

"What am I supposed to do?"

Bast didn't answer immediately. He looked at me—really looked, in the way that Fae creatures see things humans can't. Whatever he saw made him wince.

"You're broken," he said quietly. "But broken things can be mended. That's what Auri said, right? Not fixed. Mended."

"She also said some doors only close."

"And you closed one. The door that led to Kvothe the Bloodless. The man who saves the day and fixes everything." Bast reached across the table, gripped my hand. His skin was cool, his touch surprisingly gentle. "But there are other doors. New ones. The question is whether you're brave enough to open them."

"I'm not brave. I'm broken."

"Same thing, sometimes." He stood, pulling me up with him. "Come on. I know a place. Somewhere you can hide until you figure out what comes next."

"Where?"

"An inn. At the edge of things. It's been waiting for someone to take care of it." He smiled again, and this time the worry was gone, replaced by something almost like hope. "Felurian says it's where you need to be. Something about waypoints and silence and the places between stories."

I didn't understand. I was too broken to understand. But I let him lead me out of that nameless inn, into the grey light of a world that was slowly falling apart.

And I started walking toward the Waystone.

---

The oath caught up with me along the way.

I'd sworn to Denna, once. On my name. On my power. On my good left hand. I promised I would not seek her patron.

I'd broken every part of that oath in Renere. Sought her patron. Confronted him. Killed her trying to stop him.

The consequences came in stages.

First, my name. The deep knowing of who I was—Kvothe, the flame, the thunder, the broken tree—began to slip away. I'd feel it in moments of stillness: a blurring of identity, a sense that the edges of myself were dissolving.

Second, my power. Sympathy, which I'd practiced since childhood, became difficult. Then impossible. My Alar—once iron, once strong enough to split a mind in two—crumbled like rotten wood. I tried to call the wind, once. Nothing came. Not even a whisper.

Third, my hand. The left one. The chord hand. The one that had shaped music and magic for as long as I could remember. It began to lose its cunning. Notes I'd played ten thousand times came out wrong. Movements that had been instinct became effort, then impossibility.

Three things sworn. Three things broken. Three silences born.

By the time we reached the Waystone Inn, I was no longer Kvothe.

I was something else. Someone else.

The disaster that had already happened.

"The oath," Chronicler said. His pen had stopped moving. "You broke your word to Denna, and it... unmade you?"

"Oaths have power. Names have power. Promises made on your deepest self..." The innkeeper shrugged. "They're not just words. They're *bindings*. When you break them, they break you back."

"So that's why you can't..."

"Can't do magic. Can't play music. Can't be the man I was." He smiled, but there was no humor in it. "The oath was clear: on my name, my power, my good left hand. I violated every part of it. The universe keeps its books balanced."

"But the chest—"

"Is where I put the pieces that remained. The fragments of Kvothe that didn't dissolve when the oath broke." He looked toward the stairs, toward the room where the thrice-locked chest waited. "I built it myself. Roah wood, iron, copper. Three locks for three silences. And inside..."

"Your name. Your power. Your music."

"What's left of them. Barely enough to fill a matchbox, but... something." His hands clenched on the bar. "Enough to matter. Maybe. If I could ever bring myself to open it."

Bast leaned forward. "Reshi. You *can* open it. You told me yourself—you know the key, you know the locks. The only thing stopping you is—"

"Is the knowledge of what happens if I do." The innkeeper's voice was sharp. "I'm a walking disaster, Bast. The Cthaeh's influence flows through everything I touch. Every clever plan I make turns to tragedy. Every person I try to save ends up dead."

"That was before. When you were Kvothe. But you're not Kvothe anymore—you said it yourself."

"And if I open the chest, I become him again. The flame. The thunder." His voice dropped. "The broken tree that falls and kills everything in its path."

Silence.

Then Chronicler spoke, quietly.

"What if you're wrong?"

Both of them turned to look at him.

"What if the tragedy isn't because you're Kvothe—it's because you're trying *not* to be?" He set down his pen. "You've spent years hiding. Waiting. Letting the world fall apart because you're afraid of making it worse. But what if your absence is the disaster now? What if hiding is the thing that's killing everyone?"

The innkeeper stared at him.

"The war is spreading," Chronicler continued. "The Scrael are everywhere. The Penitent King is hunting anyone who might be a threat. And you're sitting in an inn, waiting for death to find you." He shook his head. "That's not penance. That's surrender."

"What's the alternative?"

"You tell me." Chronicler picked up his pen again. "You've told me the story. The whole terrible story. Now tell me what comes next."

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

Outside, the storm was breaking in earnest now. Rain hammered the windows. Thunder rolled across the sky.

And somewhere in the darkness, soldiers were riding toward the Waystone Inn.
