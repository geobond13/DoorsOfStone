THE FISHERY SMELLED of burnt metal and ambition.

I arrived just as the morning bells were fading, slipping through the heavy doors into that vast cathedral of making where the University's artificers practiced their dangerous art. The ceiling stretched high overhead, lost in shadows and soot, while below it spread a maze of workbenches, kilns, forges, and apparatus whose purposes ranged from the obvious to the incomprehensible.

Master Kilvin was already at his station, his massive frame hunched over something that glowed with a fierce orange light. Even from across the room, I could feel the heat radiating from his work—and beneath that heat, the subtle hum of sympathy that marked truly ambitious artificing.

"Re'lar Kvothe." His voice carried without shouting, a trick of resonance he'd mastered decades ago. "You are three minutes late."

"The bridge was closed for construction, Master Kilvin."

"The bridge has been closed for three days. You knew this." He didn't look up from his work. "Laziness dressed as excuse is still laziness."

"Yes, Master Kilvin."

"Come. Look at this." He gestured with a pair of tongs that could have served as weapons for a smaller man. "Tell me what you see."

I approached carefully, mindful of the heat and the scattered components that covered his workbench like the aftermath of a scholarly explosion. The glowing thing at the center was a sphere, roughly the size of my fist, suspended in a cradle of iron wire. Light pulsed within it—not firelight, something deeper, something that seemed to come from the heart of the material itself.

"It's a heat sink," I said, after studying it for a moment. "Or the beginning of one. You're trying to create a binding between the glass and an external source—probably running water, given the copper inlay."

"Running water. Cold water." Kilvin's eyes crinkled with something that might have been approval. "The Cealdish mines have a problem. Too much heat, too deep. Men die. Machines fail. They asked for a solution."

"And you're making them artificial cold."

"I am making them *sustained* artificial cold. Anyone can cool a room for an hour. I want to cool a mine for a year." He set down his tongs, wiping sweat from his forehead with a rag that was probably older than I was. "But the binding is unstable. The heat differential creates stresses the glass cannot withstand. I have tried seven different formulations. All have cracked."

"Have you considered a ceramic shell? Something with a lower coefficient of—"

"Ceramics are brittle. The mining environment is harsh. One dropped tool, one careless worker..." He shook his head. "No. The answer is in the glass. It must be in the glass."

I looked at the glowing sphere, thinking about the problem. Heat, stress, expansion, contraction. The forces involved were immense—thermal gradients that could crack stone, sustained over months or years.

"What if the problem isn't the material?" I asked slowly. "What if it's the binding itself?"

Kilvin raised an eyebrow.

"You're creating a single link between the sphere and the water source. All the stress concentrates at that connection point." I picked up a piece of chalk from the nearest bench, began sketching on the dark surface. "But what if you distributed the binding? Instead of one link, you create dozens—hundreds—each carrying only a fraction of the load."

"That would require unprecedented precision in the sympathy. The bindings would interfere with each other."

"Not if you phase them. Stagger the resonances so they reinforce rather than conflict." I was drawing faster now, the mathematics unfolding in my mind like a flower opening. "It's like a rope bridge. One strand can't hold the weight. But a hundred strands, woven together..."

Kilvin was silent for a long moment, studying my crude diagram. Then he began to laugh—a deep, rumbling sound that echoed through the Fishery and turned heads at distant workbenches.

"Re'lar Kvothe. You continue to surprise me." He clapped a massive hand on my shoulder, nearly staggering me. "This is good thinking. Not practical yet—the calculations would take weeks—but good thinking."

"I could work on the calculations. If you'd permit me access to—"

"You have your own project." His voice was stern again, though his eyes still held warmth. "The commission from Lord Bericot. The fire-resistant lamp. You are behind schedule."

I winced. He was right. The lamp had been promised for next span, and I'd barely begun the casing.

"I'll make up the time."

"You will. Or you will explain to Lord Bericot why his manor burned down because his artificer was distracted by theoretical exercises." He pointed toward the back of the Fishery, where my own small workstation waited. "Go. Work. Return to me when you have something to show."

---

My workstation was a study in controlled chaos.

Tools hung from hooks on a pegboard behind the bench—hammers and files and delicate picks, each sized for a different purpose. Drawers held components: copper wire in various gauges, glass beads, iron filings, silver solder. And spread across the work surface itself were the pieces of Lord Bericot's lamp, waiting to be assembled into something that wouldn't kill anyone.

The challenge wasn't the fire resistance—that was straightforward sympathy, a binding between the lamp's housing and a block of ice buried in his estate's icehouse. When the lamp grew too hot, the binding would activate, drawing heat away before it could ignite anything.

The challenge was making it beautiful.

Lord Bericot was a vain man who surrounded himself with beautiful things. A plain iron lamp, no matter how safe, would be rejected on aesthetic grounds. So I was working in brass and crystal, trying to create something that would satisfy both his vanity and his legitimate fear of fire.

I'd lost two brothers to a house fire, he'd told me when he placed the commission. I've spent forty years watching every candle, every hearth, every lamp in my home. I want to stop being afraid.

It was the kind of commission I loved—technically interesting, emotionally meaningful, well-paid. If I could finish it.

I settled onto my stool and began laying out the components for the day's work. The casing was nearly complete—a graceful curve of polished brass that would hold the crystal chimney. Today I needed to install the binding apparatus, the delicate network of silver wire that would connect the lamp to its distant partner.

The work was fiddly, requiring precise measurements and steady hands. I fell into the rhythm of it, the world narrowing to the bench in front of me, the tools in my hands, the soft hum of sympathy that told me the bindings were taking hold.

Time passed. The Fishery's sounds faded to background noise—the clang of hammers, the hiss of quenching, the occasional curse when something went wrong at a neighboring bench. I was aware of people moving around me, of the quality of light changing as the sun shifted outside, but none of it penetrated the focus of my work.

Until someone said my name.

---

"Kvothe?"

I looked up to find Fela standing beside my workstation, a leather satchel over her shoulder and a concerned expression on her face.

"Sorry to interrupt. You looked... intense."

"I was in the middle of a tricky binding." I set down my tools, flexing fingers that had gone stiff from gripping. "Is something wrong?"

"Nothing wrong. Just..." She hesitated. "Sim asked me to bring you this. He said you'd forget to eat if someone didn't remind you."

She produced a wrapped bundle from her satchel—bread, cheese, dried fruit, and a small bottle of ale. The kind of portable meal that could be eaten at a workbench without interrupting more than absolutely necessary.

"That's surprisingly thoughtful of him."

"He's surprisingly thoughtful in general. People just don't notice because he makes jokes about everything." She pulled up a stool, settled beside me. "Mind if I watch for a while? I'm supposed to be studying, but the Archives are..." She trailed off, her expression troubled.

"The Archives are what?"

"Strange. Lately." She unwrapped her own lunch—similar to mine, probably purchased from the same vendor. "Have you been there recently?"

"Not for a few days. I've been consumed by this." I gestured at the lamp components.

"Something's wrong there. I can't explain it exactly, but—the stacks feel different. Heavier. Like the air is thicker, or there's more weight pressing down from above." She shook her head. "Wilem noticed it too. He said it was like being underground in a cave that was about to collapse."

"That sounds concerning."

"It is. And the librarians are acting strange. Jumping at shadows. Refusing to go into certain sections alone." She bit into her bread, chewed thoughtfully. "I asked Lorren about it, and he just gave me that look of his. You know the one."

"The one that makes you feel like you've asked a very foolish question?"

"That's the one. But his eyes..." She shuddered. "His eyes weren't dismissive. They were afraid. I've never seen Master Lorren afraid of anything."

I thought about what she was describing. The Archives held many secrets—some I knew, some I could only guess at. The Four Plate Door alone was enough to justify a certain amount of unease. But for the librarians themselves to be frightened...

"I'll go take a look. After I finish this section."

"Be careful." Her voice was serious. "I don't know what's happening in there. But whatever it is, it feels like the beginning of something. Not the middle. Not the end. The start of something that hasn't shown its shape yet."

---

We ate together in companionable silence, Fela occasionally asking questions about my work while I demonstrated various components. She had a quick mind for artificing—better than many of the Re'lar who worked here full-time—and her questions pushed me to think about the project in new ways.

"The binding you're using," she said, pointing at the silver wire network. "It's similar to the kind used in heat sinks, isn't it? But inverted."

"Exactly. A heat sink draws energy toward itself. This draws it away—or rather, toward the paired object." I touched the wire carefully. "The tricky part is calibration. Too weak, and the lamp can still overheat. Too strong, and it draws so much heat that the flame goes out."

"How do you find the balance?"

"Testing. Lots of testing." I grimaced. "I've gone through a dozen prototypes already. Each one either fails to activate or activates too aggressively."

"What about a variable binding? Something that responds to the amount of heat rather than simply existing at a fixed level?"

I stared at her.

"That's... actually brilliant. A responsive threshold instead of a static one." I grabbed a piece of paper, began scribbling calculations. "The sympathetic link would need to incorporate some kind of sensing mechanism. Something that reads the current temperature and adjusts the draw accordingly."

"Could you use a bimetallic strip? The way they work in thermometers?"

"Not directly—the response would be too slow. But the principle..." I was drawing faster now, ideas cascading. "What if I used two different metals in the wire itself? One that conducts better at high temperatures, one that conducts better at low? The ratio between them would shift automatically based on conditions."

Fela leaned over my shoulder, studying the emerging design. "That could work. But you'd need metals with very specific thermal properties."

"Iron and copper, maybe. Or iron and silver." I tapped the paper. "I'd have to test the ratios. Find the right balance."

"I could help with the calculations. If you want." She smiled. "I need a break from ancient languages anyway."

"I would be very grateful."

We worked together through the afternoon, Fela's mathematical precision complementing my intuitive leaps. By the time the late-day bells rang, we'd filled a dozen pages with calculations and had a much clearer picture of what the final design would look like.

"This is good work," I said, gathering the papers. "Really good. Thank you."

"Thank me when the lamp doesn't explode." She gathered her things, preparing to leave. "Are you going to check on the Archives?"

"Tomorrow. I want to finish incorporating these ideas while they're fresh." I gestured at the modified design. "If this works, it could be revolutionary. Variable-threshold bindings could change how we approach dozens of different applications."

"Then don't let me keep you." She paused at the workstation's edge. "But Kvothe? Don't forget about the Archives. Whatever's happening there—it felt important. Like something that shouldn't be ignored."

"I won't forget."

She left, and I returned to my work.

But a part of my mind kept circling back to what she'd said. The heaviness in the air. The frightened librarians. The sense of something beginning.

---

The Fishery emptied slowly as evening approached.

Apprentices finished their work and headed to dinner. Masters checked on their students' progress, offered criticisms or rare praise, then retired to their own quarters. The great forges were banked, their fires dimmed to glowing coals that would keep the metal soft until morning.

I worked on.

The new design required careful implementation—each wire precisely placed, each junction carefully soldered. The margin for error was thin. One misaligned connection and the whole binding would fail; one crossed wire and it might do something far worse than fail.

But the work absorbed me completely. Hours passed like minutes, the world shrinking to the small circle of lamplight that surrounded my bench. I ate when hunger became distracting, drank when thirst interfered with concentration, and otherwise lost myself in the pure focus of making.

It was the state I loved best—the one where nothing existed except the problem and the solution, where my mind ran clear and fast and all the worries and fears that usually cluttered my thoughts simply... vanished.

I didn't hear the footsteps approaching.

"Re'lar Kvothe."

I jerked, nearly dropping my soldering iron. Master Kilvin stood at the edge of my workspace, his massive shadow falling across the bench.

"Master Kilvin. I didn't hear you."

"You were far away." He studied my work with those deep-set eyes that missed nothing. "Further than I've seen you before."

"I was focused."

"Yes." He didn't sound entirely approving. "There is a saying in Cealdish. *Kethos en vollar Sansen.* 'The perfect mind is a closed door.'"

"I don't understand."

"When we focus completely, we shut out everything else. All distraction, all interference." He touched one of the wires on my workbench, feeling its alignment with practiced fingers. "But we also shut out warnings. Intuitions. The small voices that tell us when something is wrong."

"Is something wrong?"

"I don't know." His voice was quiet—quieter than I'd ever heard it. "But there is a feeling tonight. In the air. In the stones of this place. A feeling I have not felt since I was young."

I looked around the Fishery. It was nearly empty now, just a few dedicated students working at distant benches. The light from the banked forges cast long shadows across the floor, and the air smelled of cooling metal and old smoke.

"What kind of feeling?"

"Anticipation. The kind that comes before a storm, or a battle." He shook his massive head. "I am probably being foolish. Old men feel premonitions in their bones that younger men rightly ignore."

"Fela said something similar. About the Archives."

"Did she." It wasn't a question. "I have heard rumors. Strange sounds in the deep stacks. Books found in places they were not left. Shadows that move against the light."

"That sounds like—"

"It sounds like stories. The kind students tell each other to pass the time." But his eyes were serious. "And yet. The Archives are old, Kvothe. Older than the University. Older, perhaps, than the knowledge of what lies beneath them."

"What does lie beneath them?"

He was silent for a long moment.

"I don't know. No one knows, except perhaps Lorren—and he does not share his secrets." He turned away from my bench. "Finish your work. But do not stay too late. There are nights when it is better to be home, with doors locked and fires bright."

"Is this one of those nights?"

He didn't answer.

He simply walked away into the shadows, and a moment later I heard the heavy doors of the Fishery close behind him.

---

I worked for another hour, trying to recapture the focus that had carried me through the day.

But it was gone.

Kilvin's words had broken something, let in air where there had been vacuum. Now I was aware of every small sound—the creak of cooling metal, the whisper of wind through gaps in the stone, the faint scuttling that might have been mice or might have been something else entirely.

The Fishery felt different at night.

During the day, it was a place of purpose and industry, full of the sounds and smells of making. But now, empty and dark, it seemed larger. Older. The shadows between the workbenches stretched toward distances that shouldn't have existed, and the ceiling overhead was lost in darkness that felt almost deliberate.

I gathered my things, carefully covered my work against dust and accidental damage, and prepared to leave.

As I walked toward the door, I passed Master Kilvin's workstation.

The sphere was still there—the heat sink prototype, suspended in its iron cradle. But it was no longer glowing. The light that had pulsed within it earlier was gone, replaced by a dull grey surface that reflected nothing.

Except...

I stopped. Looked closer.

The surface wasn't entirely dark. Deep within the glass, something moved. A shadow, coiling and uncoiling like smoke in still water. As I watched, it pressed against the inner surface of the sphere, as if testing the boundaries that contained it.

I stepped back.

The shadow went still.

For a long moment, nothing moved. The Fishery was silent around me, the shadows stretching, the darkness pressing close. Then the shadow within the sphere began to move again—slowly, deliberately, as if it knew I was watching and didn't care.

I left quickly.

Behind me, in the empty darkness of the Fishery, something that wasn't light continued to pulse.

---

The night air hit my face like cold water, clearing my head and driving away the creeping unease that had followed me through the empty building.

The University spread around me, familiar and strange in the moonlight. Students hurried between buildings, their laughter and conversation carrying on the wind. Lamplight glowed from windows, warm and ordinary. The world seemed completely normal, utterly mundane, innocent of any shadow that might coil in glass spheres or lurk in library stacks.

And yet.

Fela's words echoed in my mind. *It feels like the beginning of something.* And Kilvin's warning. *There are nights when it is better to be home, with doors locked and fires bright.*

What were they feeling? What had I almost seen in that sphere?

I walked quickly toward my room, passing through patches of lamplight and stretches of shadow. The moon was full overhead, impossibly bright, and the stars seemed closer than usual—as if they were pressing down on the world rather than floating above it.

At the corner of the Artificers' Hall, I stopped.

Something was watching me.

I couldn't see it—couldn't point to any particular shadow or outline and say "there." But the certainty was absolute. Something was out there in the darkness, its attention fixed on me like a weight between my shoulder blades.

I stood very still.

The watching continued.

Then, slowly, it withdrew. Like a tide receding, like a curtain falling. One moment it was there, pressing against my awareness; the next it was gone, leaving only the ordinary night and the ordinary sounds of students going about their ordinary lives.

I made it back to my room in record time.

And when I closed the door behind me, when I lit my lamp and sat on my bed and tried to make sense of what I'd felt, I couldn't shake the conviction that something had changed.

Something had begun.

Something that would not stop until it reached its conclusion.

---

That night, I dreamed of doors.

Not the Four Plate Door—the one in the Archives that I'd spent so long trying to understand. These were different doors. Hundreds of them. Thousands. Standing in endless rows that stretched toward a horizon that didn't exist.

And they were all beginning to open.

I woke before dawn, my heart racing, my sheets soaked with sweat.

The dream was already fading, slipping away like water through fingers. But one image remained, sharp and clear as a brand burned into my memory:

A door of black stone, covered in writing that moved and shifted and refused to be read.

And behind it, waiting with infinite patience, something that had been sealed away for so very, very long.

I didn't go back to sleep.

Instead, I sat by my window and watched the sky lighten, and tried not to think about what Kilvin's sphere had contained, or what lurked in the deep stacks of the Archives, or what might be pressing against doors that had been closed for three thousand years.

But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

And somewhere deep in my gut, in the place where intuition lives and warnings whisper, I knew that Fela had been right.

This was the beginning.

And I had no idea what was coming next.
