LORREN SUMMONED ME to his office on a Felling night.

The message came through official channels—a scriv knocking on my door, a formal note sealed with the Archives' mark. No explanation. No option to refuse.

I went.

The Master Archivist's office was deep in the Archives, past the public stacks, past the restricted sections, in a part of the building I'd never seen before. The walls were lined not with books but with locked cabinets—hundreds of them, each marked with symbols I didn't recognize.

Lorren sat behind a desk of dark wood, his face as expressionless as always. But his eyes—his eyes were different. Watchful. Assessing. The eyes of a man who had made difficult decisions and was preparing to make more.

"Kvothe." He gestured to a chair. "Sit."

I sat.

"You've been asking questions," he said. "About the Amyr. About the pruned sections. About things that most students don't know exist."

There was no point in denying it. "I have."

"Why?"

"Because I need to know the truth." I met his gaze, kept my voice steady. "My parents died for asking similar questions. I think I deserve to understand why."

Something flickered across his face—too quick to read. "Your parents. The Edema Ruh troupers. The ones who were murdered by—"

"The Chandrian. Yes."

The word hung in the air between us. Lorren's expression didn't change, but his hands—those careful, precise hands—went very still.

"That's a dangerous word," he said quietly. "A dangerous belief. People who speak that name too loudly tend to attract attention they don't want."

"I'm already attracting attention. The kind that follows you no matter how quietly you speak."

Lorren was silent for a long moment. Then he stood, walked to one of the locked cabinets, and pulled out a key that hung around his neck—a key I'd never noticed before.

"There are things you don't understand," he said, fitting the key to the lock. "Things that can't be explained in a single conversation. But you've proven yourself... persistent. And persistence, in the right hands, can be a virtue."

The cabinet opened. Inside, I could see books—old books, ancient books, the kind that should have been in the restricted sections but weren't.

"The Amyr were real," Lorren said, his back to me. "They served the Aturan Empire for centuries, enforcing order, maintaining the boundaries between what should be known and what should be forgotten."

"And when the empire fell?"

"They didn't disappear. They... adapted." He pulled out a slim volume, held it carefully. "The order continued. Changed form, changed methods, but continued. Because the work they were doing—the work of containment, of protection—couldn't stop just because empires crumbled."

"You're one of them."

It wasn't a question. Lorren turned to face me, and for the first time, I saw something like respect in his eyes.

"I'm a librarian," he said simply. "I protect knowledge. Sometimes that means preserving it. Sometimes it means destroying it. And sometimes..." He handed me the book. "Sometimes it means deciding who is ready to receive it."

The book was old. Very old. The leather binding was cracked with age, and the pages inside were covered in a script I didn't recognize—not quite Yllish, not quite Tema, something older than either.

"What is this?"

"A record. From the days before the Creation War." Lorren returned to his chair, sat down heavily. "It tells the story of the binding. The original binding—the one that closed the doors and sealed the darkness away."

"The Chandrian."

"The Chandrian are part of it. Seven anchors, holding the pattern in place. But they're not the whole story." He leaned forward, his eyes intent. "The binding was designed to last forever. But 'forever' is a very long time. And there were... flaws. Cracks that developed over the centuries. Places where the seal began to weaken."

"And the Amyr?"

"The Amyr were created to maintain the binding. To find the cracks and repair them. To hunt down anyone who might—intentionally or accidentally—make the weaknesses worse."

"Like my parents."

Lorren's face went carefully blank. "Your parents discovered something they shouldn't have. They were asking questions about the wrong subjects. Getting too close to truths that had been hidden for very good reasons."

"So the Amyr killed them?"

"No." His voice was sharp. "The Amyr protect. The Amyr preserve. We do not murder innocents."

"Then who—"

"The Chandrian." Lorren closed his eyes. "The Chandrian killed your parents. Because your parents were getting close to understanding how the binding worked. How it might be broken. And if the binding breaks..."

"The doors open."

"Everything opens. Every sealed crack, every contained darkness, every horror that's been locked away for three thousand years." His eyes opened, and they were haunted. "The Chandrian killed your parents to protect themselves. To prevent anyone from learning how to undo what was done to them."

I sat with that for a moment. The weight of it. The terrible irony.

"The Chandrian want to be free."

"Some of them. Not all." Lorren's voice was quiet. "Haliax understands the necessity of what they are. He's spent millennia holding the pattern together, sacrificing everything to keep the doors closed. But the others... Cinder especially... they've grown tired of their burden. They're looking for a way out."

"And if they find it?"

"Then everything falls apart." Lorren stood again, walked to the window. Outside, the lights of the University twinkled in the darkness. "That's why we've been watching you, Kvothe. You're connected to this—more connected than you know. Your parents' research. The troupe that raised you. The Edema Ruh blood in your veins."

"I'm not special. I'm just—"

"You're not special because of what you are. You're special because of what you might become." He turned to face me. "The Cthaeh marked you. You've spoken with namers, traveled to the Fae, learned the name of silence. You're a fulcrum, Kvothe. A point on which the future might pivot."

"I don't want to be a fulcrum."

"Nobody does. But want has very little to do with destiny." He picked up the book I'd set down, returned it to the cabinet, locked it away. "I've told you these things because you're going to keep asking questions regardless of what I say. At least now you'll have some context. Some understanding of the forces you're dealing with."

"What do you want from me?"

"Nothing. Not yet." He moved toward the door, clearly ending our conversation. "Continue your studies. Learn what you can. And when the time comes—when you have to make choices about the binding and the doors—remember that the Amyr aren't your enemies."

"And the Chandrian?"

"The Chandrian are complicated." He opened the door. "Some of them are trying to protect the world in their own twisted way. Others are trying to tear it apart. The trick is figuring out which is which."

"And Cinder?"

Lorren's expression darkened. "Cinder is trying to tear it apart. And he's been very, very patient about it."

---

"That's when you knew," Chronicler said. "About Cinder. About the conspiracy."

"That's when I knew *some* of it." The innkeeper picked up a glass, began polishing it absently. "Lorren told me the shape of the problem. What he didn't tell me—what he probably didn't know—was how deep Cinder's influence had already spread."

"Denna."

"Denna. The Jakis family. The politics of Renere. All of it connected. All of it part of a plan that had been building for centuries." He set down the glass. "I thought I understood. I thought I could see the pattern, make the right moves, stop the disaster before it happened."

"But you couldn't."

"No." His voice was very quiet. "Because understanding the pattern isn't the same as being able to change it. And some patterns are so old, so deeply woven into the fabric of the world, that they can't be stopped. Only... transformed."

"Into what?"

The innkeeper looked at him—looked through him, at something far away.

"Into tragedy," he said. "Always into tragedy."
