SHE CAME BACK on a Felling night.

I wasn't at the Eolian—hadn't been since my return, too wrapped up in research to remember simpler pleasures. But Simmon found me in my room, breathless from running, his face caught between excitement and dread.

"She's here. Denna. She's performing tonight."

I was out the door before he finished speaking.

---

The Eolian was packed.

Not the ordinary crowd of musicians and merchants, students and travelers. This was something else—people standing three deep at the bar, filling every available space, craning their necks toward the stage. Word had spread about the dark-haired woman with the impossible voice, the song that made strong men weep.

I pushed through the crowd, ignoring protests, following some instinct that guided me toward the front. And there—

*Denna.*

She stood in the circle of light that marked the performer's space, her lute held with the easy confidence I remembered. But everything else had changed. She was thinner than before, sharper somehow, as if whatever was being carved into her had pared away everything soft. Her hair was elaborately braided, patterns I could almost read woven through the darkness.

And her eyes—

Her eyes held something I'd never seen in them before. A distance. A remove. As if she was watching herself from very far away.

She saw me. I know she did. Our eyes met across the crowded room, and something flickered in her expression—recognition, perhaps, or warning.

Then she began to sing.

---

The song was beautiful.

I say that without jealousy, without bias. It was objectively, devastatingly beautiful—the kind of music that makes you forget to breathe. That reaches into your chest and rearranges something fundamental.

But it was wrong.

Not musically—every note was perfect, every phrase shaped with exquisite precision. The wrongness was in the content. In the story she told.

Lanre, she sang, was a hero.

Not the dark lord of children's nightmares. Not the monster who had destroyed seven cities in a single night. Lanre was a man who had loved his wife beyond reason, beyond death, beyond the boundaries of the possible.

When Lyra died, he had done the impossible to bring her back. And when that failed—when he understood that some doors only opened one way—he had made another choice.

He took the darkness into himself.

Not as a curse, but as a gift. Not as punishment, but as protection. He absorbed the evil that threatened to consume the world, wrapped it around his soul like armor, and became the thing he fought so that others wouldn't have to.

The Chandrian, in her song, were not villains. They were guardians. Each of them had made the same impossible choice—had taken some fragment of the darkness inside themselves, had sacrificed their humanity to keep the doors closed.

They killed, yes. They destroyed. But only to protect the greater good. Only to prevent something worse from breaking free.

By the end, half the audience was weeping.

But I wasn't.

I was watching Denna's hair. Watching the patterns shift as she sang. Watching the way her fingers moved on the strings—not just playing music, but tracing shapes. Drawing bindings in the air.

The braids weren't merely decorative. They were Yllish story knots—I recognized them now from my studies in Vintas. But these patterns were complex, layered, speaking several things at once. Most told the story she was singing: Lanre the hero, Lanre the guardian. But woven through those braids, hidden in the knots like a secret signature, was something else. A single word, repeated over and over.

A name.

I couldn't quite read it—the patterns shifted too quickly, and my Yllish was still imperfect. But I knew it was there. A truth hidden within the beautiful lie.

The song wasn't just beautiful.

It was *working*.

I could feel it—the subtle pressure of magic brushing against my mind. The whisper of suggestion, of compulsion, trying to rewrite what I knew about Lanre and the Chandrian. Trying to make me believe.

But I'd named silence. I'd spoken with the Cthaeh. Whatever part of my mind the song was trying to reach, it found only cold iron and closed doors.

The song ended.

The applause was thunderous.

And Denna's eyes met mine across the room, and I saw that she knew. Knew that I'd felt it. Knew that I understood what she'd just done.

She didn't smile.

She simply nodded, once, and slipped away into the crowd.

---

I found her in the alley behind the Eolian.

She was leaning against the wall, her lute case at her feet, staring at nothing. When she heard my footsteps, she didn't turn.

"You felt it."

"Yes."

"And it didn't work on you."

"No."

She laughed—a hollow sound. "Of course not. You're Kvothe. Everything slides off you like water off stone."

"That's not—"

"That's exactly it." She finally turned, and there were tears on her cheeks. "I've been working on that song for months. Perfecting it. Making it into a weapon that could change how people think. And the one person I wanted it to reach..."

"Wanted it to reach me? Why?"

"Because if you believed—" She stopped. Pressed her hands against her eyes. "It doesn't matter. It doesn't work on you. Nothing ever works on you."

I stepped closer. "Denna, what's happening? What are you involved in?"

"You know what I'm involved in." Her voice was bitter. "The patron. The lessons. The beatings that aren't beatings." She pulled back her sleeve, and I saw them—patterns I recognized from my research. "I'm being written, Kvothe. One word at a time."

"Then stop. Leave. I'll help you—"

"You can't." She pulled her sleeve down. "The writing doesn't just compel behavior. It binds me to him. If I try to leave, if I try to betray him..." She touched her chest. "The patterns in my flesh will strangle my heart. He showed me. He demonstrated on someone else."

"There has to be a way—"

"There isn't. I've looked. Spent months looking, even as he was writing more and more of me." She picked up her lute case. "This song—the song about Lanre—it's the culmination. The final piece. When it's complete, when enough people have heard it..."

"What happens?"

"I don't know exactly. But I know it changes things. Big things. The kind of things that have been locked away for thousands of years."

"The doors," I said. "The Doors of Stone."

Her face went pale. "How do you know about—"

"I know a lot of things. Things I shouldn't know. Things that were told to me by something that wanted to cause maximum harm." I reached for her hand. "Please, Denna. Let me help. There has to be something—"

She pulled away. "Don't. Don't touch me. Don't try to save me." Her eyes were fierce now. "You want to know the worst part? I *chose* this. In the beginning. He offered me power, knowledge, a chance to be something more than a pretty face with a good voice. And I said yes."

"You didn't know—"

"I knew enough. I knew he was dangerous. I knew there would be a price." She backed away, moving toward the street. "The song is almost finished. A few more performances, a few more minds changed, and it will have enough power to do whatever it's supposed to do. I can't stop it. You can't stop it. No one can."

"I don't believe that."

"Then you're a fool." But her voice cracked on the word. "Kvothe, please. Stay away from me. Stay away from this. Whatever happens next... I don't want you caught in it."

"I'm already caught in it."

"Then get out while you can." She was at the mouth of the alley now, silhouetted against the lamplight from the street. "Some doors only close once. When they shut, you don't get to choose which side you're on."

"Denna—"

But she was gone.

I stood alone in the alley, surrounded by shadows and the echo of a song slowly rewriting the world.

And I knew—with the terrible certainty that comes from speaking to oracles—that this was only the beginning.

Something had been building for centuries. Something that was about to break.
