I SPENT THREE days in the restricted sections.

Not the parts that were truly forbidden—even my cunning had limits. But there were places between the public stacks and the locked vaults, grey areas where the ambitious and the careful could find things that weren't exactly hidden, just... overlooked.

Yllish written magic wasn't a single discipline. It was a family of techniques, developed over centuries, refined by scholars whose names had been erased from history. The basic principles were simple enough: Yllish story knots could encode information, complex meanings compressed into patterns of thread and cord.

But the advanced applications were something else entirely.

*A pattern that compels truth-speaking.*

*A binding that prevents the utterance of certain words.*

*An inscription that rewrites memory.*

The texts I found were fragments, half-destroyed, sometimes contradictory. Someone had been through these sections before me, removing pages, blacking out passages, pruning knowledge with the same careful ruthlessness Devi had described.

But they'd missed things. Small things. Footnotes referencing other works. Margin notes in languages the censors hadn't recognized. Diagrams that seemed decorative but contained the seeds of something darker.

I copied everything I found. Drew the patterns from memory. Cross-referenced until my eyes ached and my hand cramped.

And slowly, piece by piece, I began to understand what was being done to Denna.

"The body as medium."

I was in my room at Anker's, papers spread across every surface, the candle burning low. The phrase had appeared in three separate texts, always in connection with the most powerful forms of Yllish magic.

Not writing on paper. Not weaving patterns into cloth.

Writing on skin. Carving patterns into flesh.

The beatings weren't beatings at all.

They were *inscriptions*.

I thought of the Cthaeh's words: *He beats her, you know. Two days ago he used his walking stick.*

Walking stick. A tool for writing. For carving.

Each blow would leave a mark—not just a bruise, but a pattern. Each pattern would set the magic deeper. And over time, enough patterns would create something more than a binding.

They would create a vessel.

"You look terrible."

Simmon's voice startled me. I hadn't heard him enter.

"I've been researching."

"For three days straight, apparently." He sat on the edge of my bed, studying the papers scattered around me. "Wil said you've missed classes. Kilvin's been asking about you."

"I'll make it up."

"That's not the point." He picked up one of my drawings—a complex pattern of interconnected loops. "What is this?"

"Yllish magic. The advanced kind. The kind that can rewrite a person from the inside out."

Simmon's face went pale. "Is this about Denna?"

"It's about what's being done to Denna." I stood, began pacing. "Her patron isn't just teaching her music. He's turning her into something. A weapon. A vessel. I don't know exactly what yet, but—"

"You need to slow down." Simmon's voice was firm. "You're not eating. You're not sleeping. You're obsessing over something you can't actually do anything about."

"I can't do nothing."

"I'm not saying do nothing. I'm saying do something *sane*." He gestured at the chaos of my room. "Talk to the Masters. Go to the Medica. Find someone who actually knows about this kind of magic instead of piecing it together from fragments."

"The people who know about this kind of magic are the ones doing it."

"Then find allies. People who want to stop them." He reached out, gripped my shoulder. "You're not alone in this, Kvothe. But you're acting like you are. And that's going to get you killed."

I wanted to argue. To explain that he didn't understand, couldn't understand, the weight of what I'd learned and the urgency of what needed to be done.

But looking at his face—the genuine concern, the friendship that had survived years of my arrogance and absences—I felt something loosen in my chest.

"You're right," I said finally. "I've been... focused."

"Obsessed."

"Focused." I managed a thin smile. "But I'll eat something. Sleep. Try to approach this like a sane person instead of a madman."

"That's all I'm asking." He stood, moved toward the door. "Fela and Wil want to help. Whatever this is, whatever you're planning—let us be part of it."

"It's dangerous."

"So is everything else about knowing you." His smile was rueful. "We knew what we were signing up for when we became your friends. Don't shut us out now."

I nodded. I didn't trust myself to speak.

After he left, I looked at the papers surrounding me. The patterns. The fragments. The terrible knowledge I'd assembled.

Simmon was right about one thing: I couldn't do this alone.

But he was wrong about something else. I wasn't going to find allies among the sane and the cautious. The people who could help me were the same people who frightened me.

Elodin, with his cryptic warnings and his knowledge of names.

Devi, with her scars and her secrets.

Lorren, who served the Amyr while pretending to serve only knowledge.

And somewhere out there, Denna herself—the only person who truly understood what was happening to her. If I could find her. If I could make her talk.

If she still had enough of herself left to remember who she used to be.

I gathered my papers. Organized my notes. And began planning my next move.

Tomorrow, I would return to the Archives. But not to research.

To hunt.
