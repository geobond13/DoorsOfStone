MELUAN SHOWED ME the box that evening.

We had returned from the old estate, both of us shaken by what we'd witnessed. The Maer was sleeping—a restless, fever-touched sleep that brought no real rest—and Stapes had taken Simmon and Wil to examine the food stores once more.

"This was my mother's," Meluan said, setting the small chest on the table between us. "And her mother's before her. It's been in the family longer than anyone can remember."

The box was beautiful—dark wood polished to a mirror shine, inlaid with silver patterns that seemed to shift in the candlelight. I recognized the style immediately. Roah wood. The same material I would later use to build a different kind of chest.

"I know this box."

"You've seen it?"

"My mother had one like it." The memory came back, sharp and painful. "When I was young. She never let me touch it—said it was important, said I'd understand when I was older."

"Did you ever open it?"

"No. It was lost when—" My voice caught. "When she died."

Meluan studied me for a long moment. Something shifted in her expression—not softening, exactly, but a recognition of shared loss.

"Your mother was Netalia Lackless," she said quietly. "My sister."

The words hung in the air.

"I know." My voice was steady, though my heart raced. "I've known for some time."

"And you never said anything."

"Would it have mattered?" I met her eyes. "You hate the Ruh. You hated me before you knew we were blood. Learning the truth wouldn't have changed that."

"Perhaps not." She looked at the box. "But it might have explained some things. About the box. About why you're involved in all this."

"I'm involved because the Chandrian killed my parents. Because I want revenge."

"You're involved because you're Lackless." She touched the box's surface. "The door, the guardianship, the ancient responsibility—it's in your blood, whether you want it or not. You're as bound to this as I am."

"Then tell me what's in the box."

She hesitated. "That's the problem. I can't open it."

"Can't?"

"It has no lock. No hinges. No seam that I can find." She turned the box over in her hands, showing me. "Every Lackless heir has tried. Tools break against it. Fire won't mark it. The wood is harder than iron, and the silver patterns... watch."

She pressed her thumb against one of the silver inlays. Nothing happened.

"When my mother touched it, the patterns would glow faintly. When I touch it—nothing. Whatever mechanism opens this box, it doesn't recognize me as worthy."

I reached out, then stopped. "May I?"

She nodded.

The moment my fingers touched the roah wood, I felt it. Not warmth—not exactly. More like a vibration, too deep to hear. The silver patterns flickered, then began to pulse with a pale light.

Meluan's breath caught. "It never did that for me."

I turned the box over, examining every surface. She was right—there were no seams, no hinges, no visible mechanism of any kind. But the silver patterns weren't random decorations. They were Yllish knots, ancient ones, woven into the wood in patterns that seemed to shift as I watched.

"These are names," I said slowly. "Written in Yllish story-knots. But older than any I've studied."

"Names of what?"

"Of... everything." I traced one pattern with my finger, feeling the shape of it. "Stone. Silence. Shadow. They're woven together into a single binding."

The realization hit me like cold water.

"It's not a lock," I said. "It's a test. The box opens when it hears the right name spoken by the right person."

"What name?"

I studied the patterns more carefully. The largest, most prominent knot sat at the center of the lid—a complex weave that seemed to contain all the others. I'd seen something like it before, in the oldest sections of the Archives. In the carvings on the Lackless door.

The name of stone.

Not *Cyaerbasalien*—that was too simple, too incomplete. This was something deeper. The true name, the deep name, the name that had been spoken when the world was young and stone first knew itself.

I let my sleeping mind rise. Let my waking mind fall quiet.

The box vibrated in my hands, responding to something inside me. The silver patterns pulsed brighter.

"Kvothe, what are you—"

I spoke the name.

It wasn't a word, not really. It was the sound of mountains settling. The grinding of continents. The patient silence of stone that had witnessed the birth and death of empires. It rumbled up from somewhere deeper than my chest, deeper than my bones, and the box *answered*.

The silver patterns blazed white. The roah wood trembled.

And then, with a sound like a held breath finally released, the box opened.

---

Inside, nestled in velvet that had somehow remained perfect across the centuries, lay three objects.

A ring of dark iron, sized for a large man's finger, bearing the Lackless sign—the broken wheel that was their family's sigil.

A key of tarnished silver, its teeth worn smooth by time.

And beneath them both, folded small and sealed with red wax, a letter.

But it was what lay beneath the letter that stopped my heart.

A small silver ring, delicate and feminine, inscribed with words I recognized. Words my mother used to sing.

*Seven things has Lady Lackless*
*Keeps them underneath her black dress*

"The ring unworn," I whispered. The rhyme I'd learned as a child, the one my mother forbade me from singing. The one that had always made her sad.

I picked up the letter with trembling hands. The seal was Lackless crimson, but the handwriting...

I knew that handwriting.

"Read it," Meluan said, her voice strange.

I broke the seal.

---

*If you are reading this, you have found your way home.*

*I am writing this letter knowing I may never see you again. Knowing that the choice I made—to leave my family, to follow my heart, to become something other than Lady Lackless—may have consequences I cannot foresee.*

*But some things must be said, even if they are never heard.*

*My name is Netalia Lackless. But you knew me as Laurian. As mother. As the woman who sang you to sleep and told you stories and loved you more than she ever loved the title she abandoned.*

*The box you've opened is your birthright. Inside it are the keys to your heritage—a heritage I tried to protect you from, because I knew its weight. I knew what it meant to be bound by blood to the oldest responsibility in the world.*

*The ring was my mother's, and her mother's before her. It marks you as Lackless, as true-blood, as one who carries the burden of the Door. Wear it or don't—the blood knows its own, and the duty will find you regardless.*

*The key opens a lock that you will recognize when you see it. When the time comes, you will understand.*

*But the letter beneath this one—that is the true inheritance. The secret that has passed from Lackless to Lackless for three thousand years. The knowledge of what lies behind the Door, and why it must never be opened.*

*I wanted to protect you from this. I wanted you to be free—to play music, to tell stories, to live a life unburdened by ancient wars and ancient hatreds. But I see now that was never possible. You are Lackless. You are my son. And the Doors of Stone are opening whether we will it or no.*

*Be brave, my beautiful boy. Be clever. Be kind.*

*And when you face the darkness behind the Door—remember that your mother loved you. Remember that you carry her strength, her stubbornness, her refusal to accept that the world must be as it is.*

*You are more than Lackless. You are more than Ruh. You are Kvothe, my son, and that is enough.*

*All my love, across all the years,*
*Netalia*

---

I don't know how long I sat there, the letter in my hands, tears streaming down my face.

My mother's voice. Her words. Her love, preserved across the years, waiting for me in a box that only I could open.

Meluan said nothing. Perhaps she understood. Perhaps she too had felt the weight of family secrets, the pain of connections severed by pride and time.

When I finally spoke, my voice was raw.

"There's another letter?"

"Beneath that one. I didn't know—the box has never opened before. Not for me. Not for anyone in living memory."

I set my mother's letter aside—carefully, reverently—and retrieved the second document. This one was older, the paper yellowed and fragile, the handwriting cramped and formal.

I read it aloud.

---

*To the one who opens this box:*

*You carry Lackless blood. You command the name that was woven into the binding. These are the requirements, and you have met them.*

*Now hear the burden that is yours.*

*Three thousand years ago, the world was broken. The war between those who would open and those who would close nearly destroyed everything. In the end, the Doors of Stone were sealed—but not destroyed. They cannot be destroyed. They can only be held.*

*What lies behind the Doors is not evil. It is not good. It is power—pure and ancient, the power of the Fae realm itself, concentrated and distilled into something that has slept since before mankind walked the world.*

*The seven who sealed the Doors betrayed their lord to save the world. They were cursed for their betrayal, doomed to walk the world as shadows of what they once were. But their sacrifice held. The Doors remained closed.*

*Until now.*

*The seals are weakening. The songs are being sung. The names that were buried are being spoken again.*

*You who read this—you must choose. Guard the Door, as your ancestors have done. Or open it, and face what waits within.*

*There is no middle path. There is no escape.*

*You are Lackless. This is your burden. This is your choice.*

*May you choose more wisely than those who came before.*

---

I set the letter down.

"The seven who sealed the Doors," I said slowly. "The seven who betrayed their lord."

"The Chandrian," Meluan confirmed. "They weren't always what they are now. They sealed the Doors. They saved the world. And they were damned for it."

"Then why are they trying to open them now?"

"Three thousand years is a long time to bear a curse." Her voice was bitter. "Perhaps they've decided the price was too high. Perhaps they want to undo what they did." She paused. "Whatever the cost."

I looked at the ring—my mother's ring, the ring that marked me as Lackless. Such a small thing. Such a heavy weight.

"I need to think," I said. "I need to understand all of this before—"

"Before what?"

I met her eyes—my aunt's eyes, so like my mother's now that I knew to look for the resemblance.

"Before I decide what to do about the Doors. Before I choose which side of this war I'm truly on."

She nodded slowly. Then, surprising me, she reached out and touched my hand.

"Your mother made her choice," she said quietly. "She chose love. She chose freedom. She chose you." Her voice softened. "Perhaps that wasn't weakness after all. Perhaps that was the bravest thing any Lackless has ever done."

I couldn't speak. But I held her hand for a moment—a connection across years of hatred and misunderstanding.

Then I gathered my mother's letter, the ring, the key, and the ancient words of my ancestors.

The burden of the Lackless was mine now.

And the Doors of Stone were waiting.

---

Later, alone in my chambers, I slipped my mother's ring onto my finger.

It fit perfectly, as if it had been waiting for me all along.

And somewhere in the depths of my sleeping mind, the name of silence stirred, recognizing its kin.

---

But there was more in the box than letters and rings.

At the very bottom, wrapped in cloth that crumbled at my touch, lay a stone—black as night, perfectly smooth, about the size of my thumbnail.

I picked it up. It was heavier than it looked, and warm—the same body-heat warmth I'd felt from the Lackless door. But there was something else. A vibration, too subtle to hear. A sense of incompleteness, of a larger pattern that was missing most of its pieces.

"This is a fragment," I said. "A fragment of something much larger."

"The moon's name." Meluan's voice was barely audible. "Or so the stories claim. Jax stole part of the moon's name, locked it in a box, and used that hold to keep the moon close to the mortal world. When the Doors of Stone were sealed, part of that stolen name was sealed with them."

"And this is what remains."

"This is what the Lackless family has truly been guarding. Not just the door itself—the key to the door. The fragment that could be used to complete the opening."

I set the stone down carefully.

"If someone had all the fragments—"

"They could open the doors completely. Release whatever's trapped inside." Meluan's voice was grim. "That's why the Chandrian have been hunting the Lackless family for centuries. That's why they killed your parents. They wanted this."

The pieces fell into place.

My parents hadn't died because of the song they'd written—or not only because of that. They'd died because my mother was Netalia Lackless, because she'd taken the box when she ran away with my father, because she knew secrets that Cinder wanted buried.

"The song," I said, my mind racing. "Denna's song. It's connected to all of this, isn't it?"

"It's another key. Different from the physical objects, but serving the same purpose." Meluan folded her hands. "The door has multiple seals. Physical locks, magical bindings, conceptual barriers. To open it completely, you need to break all of them."

"And the song breaks one of the conceptual barriers."

"The song changes how people think about Lanre. About the Chandrian. About what's behind the door. If enough people believe its version of history—if the collective understanding shifts—then the conceptual seal weakens."

"Mass belief as magical force," I said. "The oldest magic there is."

"Older than naming. Older than sympathy." She met my eyes. "The power of stories to shape reality."

I looked at the contents of the box—the ring, the key, the stone, the letters. My birthright. My burden.

"Then I need to counter the song," I said. "Create a different narrative. Change what people believe."

"Can you do that?"

I thought of my mother's letter. *Be brave. Be clever. Be kind.*

I thought of the ring on my finger, marking me as Lackless.

I thought of the name I had spoken—the name of stone, rising from depths I hadn't known I possessed.

"I can try," I said. "I have something they don't have."

"What's that?"

"The truth." I gathered the contents of the box—my inheritance, my mother's love, my family's ancient burden. "And I have her strength. Her stubbornness. Her refusal to accept that the world must be as it is."

Meluan looked at me for a long moment. My aunt. My enemy. My unexpected ally.

"You sound like her," she said quietly. "More than you know."

I couldn't tell if it was meant as compliment or accusation. Perhaps it was both.

But for the first time since I'd learned the truth about my heritage, it felt like something other than a curse.

It felt like a beginning.
