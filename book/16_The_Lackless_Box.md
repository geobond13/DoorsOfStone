MELUAN SHOWED ME the box that evening.

We had returned from the old estate, both of us shaken by what we'd witnessed. The Maer was sleeping—a restless, fever-touched sleep that brought no real rest—and Stapes had taken Simmon and Wil to examine the food stores once more.

"This was my mother's," Meluan said, setting the small chest on the table between us. "And her mother's before her. It's been in the family longer than anyone can remember."

The box was beautiful—dark wood polished to a mirror shine, inlaid with silver patterns that seemed to shift in the candlelight. I recognized the style immediately. Roah wood. The same material I would later use to build a different kind of chest.

"I know this box."

"You've seen it?"

"My mother had one like it." The memory came back, sharp and painful. "When I was young. She never let me touch it—said it was important, said I'd understand when I was older."

"Did you ever open it?"

"No. It was lost when—" My voice caught. "When she died."

Meluan studied me for a long moment. Something shifted in her expression—not softening, exactly, but a recognition of shared loss.

"Your mother was Netalia Lackless," she said quietly. "My sister."

The words hung in the air.

"I know." My voice was steady, though my heart raced. "I've known for some time."

"And you never said anything."

"Would it have mattered?" I met her eyes. "You hate the Ruh. You hated me before you knew we were blood. Learning the truth wouldn't have changed that."

"Perhaps not." She looked at the box. "But it might have explained some things. About the box. About why you're involved in all this."

"I'm involved because the Chandrian killed my parents. Because I want revenge."

"You're involved because you're Lackless." She touched the box's surface. "The door, the guardianship, the ancient responsibility—it's in your blood, whether you want it or not. You're as bound to this as I am."

"Then tell me what's in the box."

She hesitated. Then, slowly, she opened the lid.

---

Inside, nestled in velvet worn thin by centuries, lay three objects.

A ring of dark iron, sized for a large man's finger.

A key of tarnished silver, its teeth worn smooth.

And a stone—black as night, perfectly smooth, about the size of my thumbnail.

"The ring opens the first seal," Meluan said. "The key opens the second. And the stone..."

"The stone?"

"The stone is part of a name." Her voice dropped. "Part of the name that's been locked behind the door for three thousand years."

I reached out, then stopped. "May I?"

She nodded.

I picked up the stone. It was heavier than it looked, and warm—the same body-heat warmth I'd felt from the door. But there was something else. A vibration, too subtle to hear. A sense of incompleteness, of a larger pattern that was missing most of its pieces.

"This is a fragment," I said. "A fragment of something much larger."

"The moon's name." Meluan's voice was barely audible. "Or so the stories claim. Jax stole part of the moon's name, locked it in a box, and used that hold to keep the moon close to the mortal world. When the Doors of Stone were sealed, part of that stolen name was sealed with them."

"And this is what remains."

"This is what the Lackless family has been guarding. Not the door itself—the key to the door. The fragment that could be used to complete the opening."

I set the stone down carefully.

"If someone had all the fragments—"

"They could open the doors completely. Release whatever's trapped inside." Meluan closed the box. "That's why the Chandrian have been hunting the Lackless family for centuries. That's why they killed your parents. They wanted this."

The pieces fell into place.

My parents hadn't died because of the song they'd written—or not only because of that. They'd died because my mother was Netalia Lackless, because she'd taken the box when she ran away with my father, because she knew secrets that Cinder wanted buried.

"But they didn't get the box," I said. "My mother must have hidden it. Or sent it away before they came."

"She sent it to me." Meluan's voice was bitter. "Her sister, who she'd abandoned. Her family, who she'd shamed. A letter arrived a week before she died, with the box and a message: 'Keep it safe. Keep it hidden. They're coming.'"

"You knew. You knew who killed her."

"I knew the Chandrian were involved. I didn't know why." She met my eyes. "I hated her for leaving. For choosing a Ruh performer over her family, her duty, her blood. But when I learned she'd died to protect this..."

"You felt guilty."

"I felt ashamed." She looked away. "She'd spent her whole life running from responsibility. And in the end, she gave her life to protect it."

We sat in silence. The candle flickered between us, casting shadows that seemed to dance with meanings I couldn't read.

"The song," I said finally. "Denna's song. You said it's connected to the door."

"It's a key. Or part of one. Different from the physical objects in the box, but serving the same purpose." Meluan folded her hands. "The door has multiple seals. Physical locks, magical bindings, conceptual barriers. To open it completely, you need to break all of them."

"And the song breaks one of the conceptual barriers."

"The song changes how people think about Lanre. About the Chandrian. About what's behind the door." She paused. "If enough people believe the song's version of history—if the collective understanding shifts—then the conceptual seal weakens. Eventually, it fails entirely."

"Mass belief as magical force."

"The oldest magic there is. Older than naming, older than sympathy. The power of stories to shape reality."

I thought of the Cthaeh. Of the way its words had reshaped my understanding of everything. Of the way a single conversation had set me on a path toward disaster.

"Then we need to counter the song," I said. "Create a different narrative. Change what people believe."

"Can you do that?"

I didn't know. I was one man with a lute and a talent for trouble. Denna had been working on her song for months, backed by Cinder's ancient knowledge. Could I really outcompete that?

But I had something she didn't.

I had the truth.

Or at least, I had pieces of it—fragments that might fit together into something larger. Something more powerful than any lie.

"I can try," I said. "But first, I need to know everything. Every secret your family has kept. Every piece of the puzzle."

"Some secrets are too dangerous to share."

"And some secrets are too dangerous to keep." I stood. "The door is opening, Meluan. Whatever we do, whatever we try—time is running out. We need to work together, or we're all going to fail."

She looked at me for a long moment. My aunt. My enemy. My only ally in a war I was only beginning to understand.

"Very well," she said finally. "I'll tell you everything. But Kvothe—"

"Yes?"

"When this is over, when the door is sealed and the threat is past—don't expect forgiveness. Don't expect acceptance." Her eyes were hard. "You're still Ruh. You're still the reason my sister abandoned her family. Blood doesn't change that."

"I'm not asking for forgiveness," I said. "I'm asking for truth."

"Then truth you shall have." She opened the box again. "Let me tell you about the war that broke the world, and the price our family paid to keep it from ending."
