THE DAY BEFORE the ball, Renere went mad.

Not literally—the citizens went about their business, the merchants sold their wares, the nobles paraded through the streets in their finest clothes. But underneath the normalcy, there was a current of wrongness that everyone could feel.

The shadows were too dark.

The light was too bright.

And at odd moments, if you looked quickly enough, you could see things that shouldn't be there.

"The boundary is almost gone," Devi said, watching a patch of air that seemed to shimmer like heat rising from summer stone. "By tomorrow night, there won't be any separation at all."

"What happens then?"

"The doors open fully. Everything that's been sealed comes flooding through." She looked at me. "That's why the ritual has to happen during the ball. Cinder needs the doors at maximum weakness. He needs reality to be as thin as possible."

"Then we need to be ready."

Our preparations were simple.

We couldn't bring weapons into the ball—security would be too tight. We couldn't bring obvious tools or artifacts. Whatever we did, we'd have to do with our hands, our voices, and whatever magic we could summon in the moment.

"I'll handle the physical disruption," Simmon said. "Distraction. Confusion. Whatever I can do to break Cinder's concentration."

"That won't be enough."

"It doesn't have to be enough. It just has to buy you time." He met my eyes. "You're the one with the names. You're the one who touched the silence. Whatever has to be done at the crucial moment—you're the one who has to do it."

"And if I fail?"

"Then we all fail. But at least we'll fail trying."

---

That night, I found Denna on the roof of our lodging.

She was looking at the moon—full and bright, hanging over the city like an eye. The same moon whose name she carried. The same moon that had been stolen, broken, bound to the doors three thousand years ago.

"I remember things," she said, without turning. "From before the binding. From when I was... someone else."

"Your past life?"

"I don't think it works that way. But something." She hugged herself. "I remember standing on a balcony, looking at this same moon. Feeling the pull between worlds. Knowing that I was the bridge, and that being the bridge meant I could never fully be on either side."

"You're not the same person."

"No. But I carry her. Her name. Her nature. Her curse." She finally looked at me. "The ritual requires a channel, Kvothe. Someone who touches both worlds. Someone who can direct the energy from one realm to another."

"I know."

"There's no one else. There's never been anyone else." Her voice cracked. "I'm the only one who can do what Cinder needs. And I'm the only one who can stop him."

"There has to be another way."

"There isn't." She took my hand. "I've thought about it. Researched it. Talked to Devi and Manet and everyone who might know something useful. The channel has to be someone with my nature. And there's only one person in the world with my nature."

"Denna..."

"Let me finish." She squeezed my hand. "If I direct the energy into Cinder, he becomes a god. If I direct it somewhere else—if I break the channel before it can complete—"

"The energy disperses. The world ends faster."

"Maybe. Or maybe it just... goes nowhere. Dissipates without doing anything." She smiled sadly. "I don't know. No one knows. But it's the only option we have."

"You'd die."

"I'd become something else. Like the text said—part of the seal. Part of the door." She looked at the moon. "Maybe I'd finally be whole. Finally be in one place instead of torn between worlds."

"That's not comfort."

"No. It isn't." She leaned against me. "But it's what we have."

---

I held her for a long time.

The moon moved across the sky. The city slept, dreaming dreams that weren't quite natural. And somewhere, in a palace built on ancient binding, Cinder prepared for his moment of triumph.

"I don't want to lose you," I said finally.

"You lost me years ago." Her voice was gentle. "When Cinder found me. When he started writing on my soul. The Denna you knew—she's been gone for a long time. What's left is just... an echo."

"That's not true."

"Isn't it?" She pulled back, looked at me. "I can't remember what I was like before him. Can't remember my dreams, my hopes, my reasons for doing anything. All I have are the commands he wrote and the choices I made while following them."

"You chose to break free."

"Did I? Or did you choose for me when you spoke my name?" She shook her head. "I don't know anymore. That's the worst part. I don't know which parts of me are real and which parts are just... patterns he left behind."

"You're real." I touched her face. "This, right now—this is real. You're sitting here, making choices, deciding what to do. That's not an echo. That's not a pattern. That's you."

Denna was quiet for a long moment. Then she reached for the collar of her dress, hesitated.

"Can I show you something?"

I nodded.

She pulled the fabric aside, revealing the skin above her collarbone. In the moonlight, I could see the raised marks of Yllish knots—Cinder's bindings, carved into her flesh. But there was something else. Beneath them, woven through them, a different pattern. Smaller. Subtler. Written in faded ink rather than scarred into skin.

"What is that?"

"My answer." Her voice was quiet but fierce. "He thought he was clever, writing his commands where I couldn't see them. On my back. Behind my ears. Places I'd need mirrors to find." A thin smile. "But I learned Yllish too, Kvothe. I've been learning for months. Every time he wrote on me, I studied what he'd done. And then I wrote my own words. Counter-knots. Negations."

I stared at her. "You've been fighting him this whole time."

"Not fighting. Not yet." She traced one of the ink patterns with her finger. "These are... preparations. Seeds, if you like. They don't do anything on their own. But when the moment comes—when I need them—they'll give me a chance. A fraction of a second where his commands won't hold."

"How long have you been doing this?"

"Since Severen. Since I realized what he was really doing to me." Her eyes met mine, and there was something in them I hadn't seen before. Not desperation. Not fear. Defiance. "He thinks he owns me. He's wrong. He owns a mask. A performance. The real Denna has been hiding underneath, waiting for the right moment to show him exactly how wrong he was."

"Denna..."

"I've been playing his game for months, Kvothe. Pretending the bindings had me completely. Letting him believe I was his perfect puppet." She laughed—a real laugh, sharp and bitter and triumphant. "I'm very good at playing roles. You of all people should know that."

I thought of all the times I'd seen her—distant, controlled, moving like a woman in a dream. I'd assumed the bindings had taken her completely. But now...

"You were acting. The whole time."

"Not the whole time. The bindings are real. The compulsion is real. But there's always been a part of me he couldn't touch. The part that watches. That waits. That remembers who I was before him." She pulled her collar closed. "Tomorrow, when the ritual begins, he'll think I'm his instrument. His perfect channel. And for most of it, I will be—I have to be, or he'll sense something wrong."

"But?"

"But when the moment comes—when he needs me most—I'm going to break free. Just for a second. Just long enough to make my own choice." Her hand found mine again. "Whatever happens after that, Kvothe—whatever I have to become—it will be because I chose it. Not because he commanded it. Me. My decision. My sacrifice."

"Maybe." She closed her eyes. "Or maybe I just want to believe that. Maybe wanting to believe is the realest thing I have left."

---

We didn't sleep.

Instead, we talked. About everything. About nothing. About the years we'd known each other and the years we'd wasted and the things we should have said when we had the chance.

"I loved you from the first moment," I admitted. "On the caravan to Imre. I looked at you and knew—this person matters. This person will change everything."

"I knew too." Her voice was soft. "But I was afraid. Afraid of what loving you would mean. Afraid of what it would cost."

"What did you think it would cost?"

"Myself." She laughed quietly. "And I was right, wasn't I? Loving you cost me everything. My freedom, my choices, my future."

"That wasn't love's fault. That was Cinder."

"Was it? Or was Cinder just the shape my fear took?" She looked at me. "I was always going to run, Kvothe. Always going to push you away. Always going to choose safety over connection. Cinder just... accelerated the process."

"You don't believe that."

"I don't know what I believe." She stood, walked to the roof's edge. "Tomorrow, one way or another, it ends. Either I become the channel and Cinder wins, or I break the channel and... something else happens."

"Something else."

"Maybe I become the seal. Maybe I just... stop existing. Maybe the energy tears me apart and there's nothing left at all." She turned to face me. "But whatever happens, I want you to know: this night. This conversation. This moment of being real with you—it's enough. It's more than I ever expected."

"It's not enough for me."

"It has to be." She smiled, and it was the most genuine expression I'd seen from her in years. "We don't get happy endings, Kvothe. People like us, who carry too much and trust too little—we get moments. Fragments. Brief touches of something beautiful before it slips away."

"That's not true."

"It's always been true. We just didn't want to see it." She took my hands. "But here's the thing: even the moments matter. Even the fragments are precious. They're worth everything we pay for them."

"I don't accept that."

"You don't have to accept it. You just have to live it." She kissed me—gently, briefly, like a goodbye. "Tomorrow, we fight. Tonight, we remember. And whatever happens after..."

"After?"

"After, we become whatever we have to become." She lay down on the roof, pulling me beside her. "Now be quiet. Watch the stars. Let me pretend, for just a few hours, that the world isn't ending."

I lay beside her.

Watched the stars wheel overhead.

And tried not to think about what was coming.
