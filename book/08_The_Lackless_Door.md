MELUAN LED ME through passages I'd never seen.

We descended through the estate—down stairs carved from living stone, through corridors lit by lamps that burned without oil, past doors sealed with sigils I didn't recognize. The air grew colder as we went deeper, taking on the weight of ancient places. The smell of old stone and older secrets.

Neither of us spoke. What was there to say? She had known my blood since the moment she'd seen me, and she'd said nothing. I'd hidden my heritage because I thought it would get me killed, and I'd been right in all the wrong ways.

Finally, we reached a door.

It was plain—almost disappointingly so. Dark wood, iron bands, a simple handle. Nothing to mark it as special except the feeling that radiated from it. A *presence*, almost. Like standing too close to a fire, or too near the edge of a very tall cliff.

"This is the outer seal," Meluan said. Her voice echoed strangely in the narrow corridor. "The door itself is beyond."

"How old is this place?"

"Older than the Lackless name. Older than Vintas. Perhaps older than the Four Corners themselves." She produced a key from somewhere in her robes—a simple thing, iron, worn smooth by centuries of hands. "My family has kept this door for three thousand years. Passing the duty from mother to daughter, generation after generation."

"What's behind it?"

"I told you. Nothing." She fitted the key to the lock. "And everything."

The door opened.

---

The chamber beyond was vast—far larger than the corridor suggested. The walls curved up into darkness, their surface covered with carvings I couldn't quite make out. Old writing. Yllish, perhaps, or something older still.

And at the center of the chamber, raised on a dais of black stone...

The door.

Not a door like I'd ever seen. It was made of... I didn't know what it was made of. Stone, maybe. Or metal. Or something that predated both. It was grey and black and somehow neither, catching the lamplight in ways that hurt to look at.

Four plates were set into its surface—copper and iron, silver and something I didn't recognize. Each plate was inscribed with symbols that shifted when I looked at them directly. Names, perhaps. Or warnings. Or both.

"The four-plate door," I breathed.

"One of them." Meluan moved past me, approaching the dais. "There are others. In the Archives. In Renere. In places that no longer have names. They're all connected. All part of the same seal."

"A seal against what?"

"Against what's behind them." She stopped at the base of the dais, looking up at the door with an expression I couldn't read. "My family's stories say that something was locked away, long ago. Something that couldn't be killed, only contained. The doors are part of that containment."

"Iax," I said. "The old stories talk about Iax being locked behind the Doors of Stone."

"The stories are partly right." She turned to face me. "Iax is part of it. But there's more. Much more."

"Tell me."

She was quiet for a long moment. Then she reached into her robes again and produced something small. A box.

The Lackless box.

I'd seen it before, in her chambers at the Maer's court. Dark wood, smooth as glass, with no visible seams or hinges. I'd felt its weight, its strange warmth. I'd wondered what was inside.

"My family's oldest heirloom," Meluan said. "Passed down since before the Lackless name existed. Since before there were families at all, if the oldest stories are true."

"What's in it?"

"I don't know. No one knows. It can't be opened—not by force, not by lockpicks, not by any means we've ever found." She held it out to me. "But I think you might be able to."

I stared at her. "Why me?"

"Because of what you are." Her eyes met mine, and there was something in them I hadn't expected. Not hatred—not anymore. Something more like resignation. "You're the first Lackless male born in three thousand years. The prophecies say—"

"What prophecies?"

"Old ones. Older than the family. They say that when the line produces a son, the box will open. The doors will unlock. And whatever was sealed away will finally be released."

I looked at the box. At the door behind her. At the weight of centuries pressing down on this hidden chamber.

"You think I'm meant to open it."

"I think you're meant to *choose*." She pressed the box into my hands. "The question is what you'll choose to do."

---

The box was warm against my palms.

Not hot—just warm. Like something alive. I could feel a faint vibration, almost a hum, running through its surface. And underneath that, something else. A pulling. A calling. Like the box knew I was holding it and was... reaching for me.

"I can feel something," I said. "Inside. It's—"

"Don't."

The voice came from the darkness at the edge of the chamber. Both Meluan and I spun toward it.

A figure emerged from the shadows. Tall. Elegant. Dressed in the dark robes of a scholar, with white hair and eyes that glittered in the lamplight.

Bredon.

"I should have known you'd come here," he said, his walking stick tapping against the stone floor. "The prodigal son, finally claiming his inheritance."

"What are you doing here?" Meluan's voice was sharp with surprise. "This chamber is forbidden to all but—"

"All but the Keepers. Yes, I know." Bredon smiled—that pleasant, dangerous smile I remembered from his games of tak. "Fortunately, I happen to be one. Have been for a very long time."

"That's impossible. The Keepers are women. The Lackless line—"

"Is not the only line that guards these doors." Bredon stopped at the base of the dais, looking up at the four-plate door with an expression of profound weariness. "There are others. Older orders. We've been watching the seals since before your family had a name."

"The Amyr," I said.

Bredon turned to look at me. His eyes were very old suddenly—far older than his face.

"Something like that."

---

"You lied to me." I set the box down on the edge of the dais—carefully, unwilling to let it go entirely. "At the Maer's court. You pretended to be just another player of the beautiful game."

"I was playing the beautiful game. Just a larger version than you knew." Bredon moved past me, studying the door with the practiced eye of someone who had seen it many times before. "The question is whether you understand the stakes now."

"Enlighten me."

"The Chandrian," he said simply. "You've been hunting them your whole life. Seeking revenge for what they did to your family."

"Yes."

"And what do you think will happen if you succeed? If you find a way to kill them?"

I didn't answer. I'd never thought that far ahead. The revenge had always been the goal—the end point. What came after had never seemed to matter.

"The Chandrian are bound," Bredon continued. "Cursed, if you prefer. They're not free agents causing chaos for its own sake. They're *contained*. Like whatever is behind these doors."

"Contained by what?"

"By the same seal that holds everything else." He turned to face me, and his expression was deadly serious. "The old stories say the Chandrian betrayed the cities during the Creation War. That they turned against their own people and helped Iax steal the moon. What the stories don't say is *why*."

"Tell me."

"Because they had no choice. They were weapons—made by forces older than Ergen, shaped to destroy and deceive. When the war ended, the victors couldn't destroy them. They could only bind them. Lock them in human forms, chain them to curses that would keep them weak."

"Haliax keeps them in check," I said slowly. "That's what the stories say. He controls the other six."

"Haliax *contains* them. There's a difference." Bredon's voice was very quiet. "He's the linchpin of the binding. The keystone of the arch. If he falls—if any of them die—the binding weakens. Crack it enough times, and eventually..."

"The doors open."

"The doors open. And what's behind them comes through."

I thought about that. About the Chandrian, who I'd spent years hating. About Haliax, who I'd imagined killing a thousand different ways.

About what it would mean if killing them was the worst thing I could do.

"The Amyr," I said. "They're not hunting the Chandrian. They're *protecting* them."

"We're protecting everyone. The Chandrian included." Bredon picked up the Lackless box, turning it over in his hands. "For the greater good. That's our motto, isn't it? We do what must be done, regardless of how it looks. Regardless of what history will say about us."

"But the stories—"

"Are lies. Written by people who didn't understand. Who couldn't be trusted with the truth." He set the box back down. "The Amyr weren't disbanded by the church because we were too brutal. We were hidden because our work was too important to be visible. Too dangerous to be known."

"And me?" I asked. "Where do I fit into this?"

Bredon was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was heavy with something that might have been regret.

"You're the variable we didn't anticipate. The son of a Lackless daughter, raised outside the traditions, unbound by our oaths." He looked at me—really looked, seeing something I couldn't see myself. "You could open that box, Kvothe. Right now. I can see the potential in you. The connection."

"And if I do?"

"Then everything changes. The binding shifts. The doors... adjust." He shook his head. "I don't know what would happen. No one does. It's never been tested."

"You want me to leave it alone."

"I want you to understand what you're choosing." He stepped back from the dais, his walking stick tapping against the stone. "The Chandrian are monsters. I won't deny that. But they're *contained* monsters. Chained beasts. If you break those chains seeking vengeance—"

"I unleash something worse."

"Yes." His voice was very soft. "Much worse."

I stood there, in that ancient chamber, with the box in my hands and the door looming behind me, and I felt the weight of every choice I'd ever made pressing down on my shoulders.

My parents were dead. Murdered by creatures I'd sworn to destroy. And now I was being told that destroying them might end the world.

"There has to be another way," I said.

"Perhaps." Bredon smiled—sad, knowing. "That's what we've been looking for. For three thousand years. A way to end the binding without releasing what it holds. A way to give the Chandrian the death they deserve without cracking the seal."

"Have you found it?"

"Not yet. But we're closer than we've ever been." He reached into his robes and produced something—a small piece of folded paper. "There's a woman. You know her. She's been working on something that might change everything."

My blood went cold. "Denna."

"Her song isn't what you think. It's not rehabilitation—it's *rewriting*. She's found a way to use Yllish knots to modify the binding itself. To shift the burden from Haliax to... someone else."

"Someone else? Who?"

Bredon didn't answer. He just looked at me with those ancient, terrible eyes.

And suddenly I understood.

"Cinder," I breathed. "She's rewriting the binding to give Cinder control."

"Not give. Take." Bredon's voice was grim. "Her patron isn't using her to free the Chandrian. He's using her to *become* them. To seize Haliax's power for himself."

"Who is he?"

"You already know." Bredon turned away, moving toward the shadows at the edge of the chamber. "Think about it. Who has white hair? Who moves like winter itself? Who has been watching you and Denna since the moment you arrived in Vintas?"

He paused at the edge of the light.

"Cinder isn't hunting the Amyr, Kvothe. He's trying to become the only thing that matters. And he's using the woman you love to do it."

Then he was gone, swallowed by the darkness, leaving me alone with the box and the door and the terrible weight of everything I'd just learned.

---

"Bredon was Amyr."

Chronicler's voice was barely a whisper. The fire had burned down to coals, casting the Waystone in shades of red and shadow.

"Yes." The innkeeper's hands had stopped moving. "I should have seen it earlier. The walking stick, the games, the way he always seemed to know more than he should. But I was too focused on the obvious to see what was hidden in plain sight."

"And Cinder..."

"Was Denna's patron. Had been all along. Master Ash. Ferule. The monster who killed my parents." The innkeeper's voice was flat, empty. "He was turning her into a weapon. And I was too busy being angry at her secrets to see what was happening."

"What did you do?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"I made a choice," he said finally. "The wrong one, as it turned out. But it seemed right at the time. It always seems right at the time."

He picked up his cloth and began to wipe the bar again. That endless, futile motion.

"I decided to save her. To find Cinder and stop whatever he was building. To tear down his plans before they could reach fruition."

"And?"

"And I failed. Spectacularly." He set down the cloth. "But that's the next chapter, isn't it? The part where everything falls apart."
