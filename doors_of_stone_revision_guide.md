# The Doors of Stone: Comprehensive Revision Guide

## For Claude Code Expansion Pass

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: 70,350 words across 55 chapters + prologue/epilogue
**Target State**: 300,000-350,000 words (4-5x expansion)
**Core Issue**: This is a well-structured plot outline expanded into prose, not yet a fully-realized novel

This is the EPIC FINALE to a 15-year wait. It must match or exceed the density of the previous books. Wise Man's Fear is 395,000 words and it's the MIDDLE book that "doesn't end." Book 3 must resolve everything—every thread, every mystery, every character arc. Readers will want to live in this book.

The skeleton is strong. The plot works. Now it needs flesh, breath, and the distinctive Rothfuss texture that makes readers linger on every page.

## Part I: Word Count Analysis

### Current vs. Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Total words | 70,350 | 300,000-350,000 | +230,000-280,000 |
| Avg chapter length | 1,270 | 5,000-6,000 | +4,000 |
| Scenes per chapter | 1-2 | 5-8 | +4-6 |
| Total chapters | 55 | 60-70 | +5-15 new chapters |

### Comparison to Canon

- *The Name of the Wind*: 259,000 words
- *The Wise Man's Fear*: 395,000 words
- *Current Draft*: 70,350 words (18% of WMF)
- *The Price of Remembering* (other fan fic): ~120,000 words

**Reality Check**: WMF is 395K and it's the MIDDLE book that notoriously "doesn't resolve anything." Book 3 must:
- Match that density
- Resolve every thread from two books
- Deliver the emotional payoff of 15 years of anticipation
- Give every beloved character their due

### The Density Problem

Rothfuss spends:
- 5,000 words on a single dinner conversation
- 8,000 words on a Tak game
- 15,000 words on a trial at the University
- 20,000 words on the Adem (culture, training, philosophy)

This draft covers weeks of travel in half a chapter. The plot efficiency is a bug, not a feature—readers come to Kingkiller for the meandering, the texture, the lived-in feeling of a world that breathes.

### What 300K Words Looks Like

At 300,000 words with 65 chapters:
- Average chapter: 4,600 words
- Room for 10-15 "big" chapters at 8,000+ words
- Room for texture, banter, world-building
- Room for the story to BREATHE

### What Fills 300K Words (Content Guide)

**The "Texture" Scenes Rothfuss Would Write**:
- A full chapter of Kvothe playing at the Eolian one last time (5,000 words)
- Wil and Sim helping Kvothe study, arguing about Yllish grammar (4,000 words)
- A complete Adem chapter: returning to Haert, speaking with Vashet about what's coming (6,000 words)
- Devi's full backstory: why she was expelled, what Lorren did, her vendetta (5,000 words)
- Three separate Tak games with Bredon, each revealing more (8,000 words total)
- Auri showing Kvothe the hidden library, her philosophy of broken things (6,000 words)
- A trial at the University when Kvothe returns—Hemme's accusations, defense (8,000 words)
- The journey to Renere: inns, conversations, a bandit encounter, landscape (12,000 words)
- Court life at Severen: meals, politics, Stapes navigating Kvothe through etiquette (10,000 words)
- Denna and Kvothe's conversations: not about plot, about music, about names, about the moon (10,000 words)

**The "Lore" Scenes That Deepen the World**:
- The full story of Lanre and Lyra, told as story-within-story (10,000 words)
- The Creation War explained through multiple sources, contradictions included (8,000 words)
- The history of Renere: why it's the City of Doors, what was sealed there (5,000 words)
- The Amyr's true history: not heroes, not villains, but keepers (6,000 words)
- What the Cthaeh actually is, theories and fears (4,000 words)

**The "Character" Scenes That Make Death Hurt**:
- Sim confessing his fears to Kvothe the night before they leave (3,000 words)
- Fela giving Kvothe a gift—something small, meaningful (2,000 words)
- Wil's quiet loyalty, a scene where he doesn't speak but his presence matters (2,500 words)
- Devi's vulnerability beneath the bravado (3,000 words)
- Bast in the frame story: his terror, his love, his alienness (5,000 words across interludes)

**The "Aftermath" Scenes That Let Tragedy Land**:
- The immediate aftermath of Denna's death: Kvothe in shock, guards surrounding him (4,000 words)
- Escape from Renere: the city in chaos, fire, screaming (5,000 words)
- The days after: Kvothe not speaking, not eating, Auri finding him (6,000 words)
- Learning what happened to the others: Sim, Wil, Fela, Devi—scattered, hunted (4,000 words)
- Building the chest: the ritual, the locks, what goes inside (6,000 words)
- Becoming Kote: the journey to Newarre, choosing the name, the first silence (8,000 words)

## Part II: Critical Plot Deviations from Bible

### A. The "Kingkiller" Moment is Missing/Unclear

**Bible Version**: 
- King Roderic dies at the Renere Ball
- He dies as COLLATERAL DAMAGE from Kvothe's Name of Silence
- Same moment that kills Denna
- Kvothe is so focused on Cinder he doesn't notice a king standing in his way
- The "Kingkiller" title is tragic carelessness, not assassination

**Current Draft**:
- King's death is offscreen/unclear
- The Caesura ("poet-killer") significance is unexplored
- The title "Kingkiller" remains unexplained

**Required Fix**:
1. Roderic Calanthis must be PRESENT and NAMED in the ball sequence
2. His death must occur in the SAME MOMENT as Denna's
3. The silence that stops Denna's song must also stop the King's heart
4. Kvothe must realize what he's done only AFTER

**New Chapters Needed**:
- 3 chapters of court politics BEFORE the ball where Kvothe interacts with the King
- Makes the death tragic rather than incidental
- Establishes Roderic as a person, not a plot point

---

### B. Denna's Death: Sacrifice vs. Accident

**Bible Version**:
- Denna dies because Kvothe speaks the Name of Silence
- He's aiming for Cinder/the song, but Denna IS the song
- "I stopped her breath to save the world. I was too clever by half."
- This is the CENTRAL TRAGEDY—Kvothe kills the woman he loves through arrogance

**Current Draft**:
- Denna CHOOSES to sacrifice herself to become the seal
- This is noble, redemptive
- It lets Kvothe off the hook
- He becomes a witness to tragedy rather than its author

**Required Fix**:
The draft must be revised so that:
1. Denna does NOT choose sacrifice
2. Kvothe's act of silencing the song IS the act that kills her
3. The realization must be devastating, not redemptive
4. Frame story dialogue must reflect guilt, not grief

**Key Line to Restore**:
> "I have called the wind and spoken the name of Fire. I have stopped the breath of a woman."

---

### C. Cinder's Fate

**Bible Version**:
- Cinder is severely diminished or killed at Renere
- He flees, wounded, his plans in ruins
- Haliax appears to deliver understanding, not vengeance

**Current Draft**:
- Cinder survives and becomes a TEACHER figure
- Mountain sanctuary chapters show him mentoring Kvothe
- This undercuts his role as the villain who killed Kvothe's parents

**Required Fix**:
- Cinder must be antagonist through the end
- The mountain sequence should be CUT or reframed as trap/manipulation
- Any "teaching" from Cinder should feel sinister, not wise

---

### D. Missing Bible Elements

The following planned elements are absent or underdeveloped:

1. **The Carving Concept**
   - Cinder's beatings are Yllish inscriptions, not sadism
   - Denna is being MADE INTO the song
   - The knots in her flesh will kill her if she betrays him
   - When Kvothe sees the marks on her skin, he understands too late

2. **The Renere Ball Merged Catastrophe**
   - Single terrible moment kills Denna AND King
   - Cinder flees in the chaos
   - Haliax appears in aftermath

3. **The Devi Thread**
   - She calls in her debt
   - Her motivations tie to Lorren grudge
   - She puts Kvothe on the road to Renere

4. **Auri's Rescue**
   - Through the between-places
   - Honors *The Slow Regard of Silent Things*
   - "Broken things can be mended. Not fixed. Mended."

5. **The Penitent King Reveal**
   - Alveron becomes king after Roderic's death
   - Marries Meluan (Kvothe's aunt)
   - "Penitent" for embracing iron church to restore order
   - Hunts Kvothe forever

---

## Part III: Voice and Style Issues

### A. Sentence Rhythm

**Problem**: Too many short, staccato sentences
**Example from draft**: "I stayed. Not because I trusted Cinder—I didn't."

**Rothfuss writes in flowing periods**:
- Long sentences that build and crest
- Short sentences for impact, used sparingly
- Parallel structures that create musicality

**Fix**: Every chapter needs a rhythm pass. Read Rothfuss, then revise.

### B. Sensory Poverty

**Problem**: Not enough smell, touch, temperature, physical sensation

**Current**: "The hidden library was smaller than I expected."

**Rothfuss would write**: The smell of old paper and dust. The way the air felt thick and still. The particular quality of light from a single lamp. The texture of crumbling bindings under fingertips.

**Fix**: Every scene needs at least 3 sensory details beyond sight.

### C. Telling Over Showing

**Problem**: Emotional states declared rather than demonstrated

**Current**: "I felt hope."

**Rothfuss approach**: Layer metaphor, physical sensation, and implication. Let the reader FEEL the hope through accumulated detail.

**Fix**: Search for "I felt" and "I realized" and rewrite each instance.

### D. Modern Phrasing

**Problem**: Contemporary speech patterns breaking immersion

**Examples to eliminate**:
- "That's the question, isn't it?"
- "I don't know what I'm going to do"
- Direct, modern dialogue patterns

**Fix**: Read dialogue aloud. If it sounds like 2024, rewrite it.

---

## Part V: Specific Scene Rewrites

### A. The Renere Ball Catastrophe (Chapters 35-38)

**Current State**: Spread across chapters, unclear climax, ~4,500 words total
**Required**: Complete rewrite as unified catastrophe, 25,000+ words

**New Structure**:

**Chapter 35: The Ball Begins** (6,000 words)
- Arrival at the palace, description of grandeur
- The masks, the music, the chandeliers
- Kvothe's disguise, his careful observation
- The nobility—describe specific characters, conversations overheard
- Spot Cinder across the room (slow burn, not immediate)
- Spot Denna near the King—she looks afraid
- End on rising tension, not action

**Chapter 36: The Beautiful Game** (6,500 words)
- Kvothe and Cinder circling through the crowd
- Conversations with nobles (texture, world-building)
- A dance sequence—Kvothe dances with someone, watches Cinder
- Denna intercepts him, tries to warn him away
- Their conversation is interrupted
- Cinder forces her toward the King's private performance
- The Yllish knots on her skin begin to glow (only Kvothe sees)
- King Roderic established as a CHARACTER—dialogue, personality, tragedy

**Chapter 37: The Confrontation** (6,500 words)
- Kvothe follows to the private chamber
- Denna begins to sing—the song we've been dreading
- Description of what the song DOES—reality bending, the binding cracking
- Kvothe interrupts—magic erupts
- The fight spills into the ballroom
- Chandelier crashes, guards draw swords, nobles scream
- Sympathy, Naming, ancient power—full magical combat
- King Roderic steps between them, trying to restore order
- "Stop this madness! I am your KING!"
- Cinder uses the moment, forces Denna to complete the song

**Chapter 38: The Name of Silence** (6,000 words)
- Kvothe feels the world TILTING
- He has no choice—speaks the Name of Silence
- Time slows for the description:
  - The silence expanding outward
  - Denna's mouth still open, mid-note, then stopping
  - The King's hand on his chest, confusion, then stillness
  - Cinder staggering backward, the binding incomplete
  - The absolute absence of sound
- Time resumes—chaos, screaming, horror
- Kvothe kneels in wreckage holding Denna
- King's body three feet away
- Guards closing in
- Cinder fleeing through a side door
- Understanding, too late, of what he's done
- "I stopped her breath to save the world."

---

### B. The Chest Opening (Chapter 54)

**Current State**: Chest opens relatively easily, hopeful tone
**Required**: The unlocking must be a BATTLE

**Rewrite Focus**:
- The three locks fight him
- The silence inside the chest recognizes the silence inside him
- The room should be DESTROYED by the struggle
- Bottles shatter, furniture breaks
- Bast is terrified, not hopeful
- When it opens, the return of Kvothe should feel DANGEROUS
- Not triumphant—terrifying
- What emerges is not the old Kvothe but something new

---

### C. Bredon's Revelation (Chapter 18)

**Current State**: Exposition dump
**Required**: Show through Tak game

**Scene Structure**:
- Set in garden, afternoon light
- Tak board between them
- Bredon explains as he plays
- Each revelation corresponds to a move
- "The Beautiful Game isn't about winning pieces. It's about creating a position where your opponent makes the move you want."
- The game itself should mirror the conversation
- Bredon should WIN the game while appearing to lose
- Kvothe realizes he's been played only after

---

### D. The Carving Scene (Chapter 25 - ADD/EXPAND)

**Current State**: Underdeveloped or missing
**Required**: Full scene showing Yllish marks on Denna

**Scene Must Include**:
- Kvothe sees Denna's bare shoulders/back
- The marks he thought were bruises are PATTERNS
- Yllish knots written into her flesh
- "He's not beating you. He's WRITING on you."
- Denna's response: she KNOWS
- "I can feel them. The words under my skin. They're what let me sing the song."
- Kvothe's horror: she's not a victim—she's a VESSEL
- This sets up why silencing the song means silencing HER

---

## Part VI: Prose Anchors (Voice Consistency Check)

Use these benchmarks every 5-10 chapters:

### Sentence Rhythm Test
Read a paragraph aloud. Does it have:
- Variation in sentence length?
- At least one sentence over 30 words?
- Parallel structures?
- A short sentence used for impact (not default)?

### Sensory Checklist
Does every scene include:
- [ ] At least one smell
- [ ] At least one texture/touch
- [ ] Temperature or air quality
- [ ] Sound (or meaningful silence)
- [ ] Light quality

### Vocabulary Check
Scan for these words and REPLACE:
- "realized" → show the realization
- "felt" (emotion) → demonstrate the feeling
- "very" → cut or find stronger word
- "really" → cut
- "just" → usually cut
- Modern phrases → archaicize

### Unreliable Narrator Moments
Every 10 chapters, include at least one moment where:
- Kvothe's account seems self-serving
- Chronicler or Bast questions something
- The reader can doubt the literal truth

---

## Part VII: The Ending Question

### Current Ending
Kvothe opens chest, regains power, walks out to be hero again.
**Tone**: Hopeful, action-oriented

### The Problem
This contradicts the frame story's tragedy. Kote is a man waiting to die.

### Options

**Option A: The Loop (Tragic)**
- He finishes the story
- The soldiers come
- He dies defending the Inn
- Released from waiting at last
- The ultimate tragedy

**Option B: Current Ending (Hopeful)**
- The act of telling cures him
- He breaks the silence
- Returns to the world
- **To earn this**: The chest opening must be VIOLENT
- The Third Silence must be broken with cost

### Recommendation
If keeping Option B (hopeful ending):
- Make the unlocking terrifying, not triumphant
- The silence fights back HARD
- Something is lost in the exchange
- Kvothe returns, but changed
- Not a restoration—a transformation
- Leave ambiguity about what he's become

---

## Part IX: Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Epic (Must Hit)
- [ ] 250,000+ words
- [ ] 60+ chapters
- [ ] King's death on-page, same moment as Denna's
- [ ] Kvothe is CAUSE of tragedy, not witness
- [ ] Cinder defeated/fled (not mentor)
- [ ] Voice consistent with Rothfuss
- [ ] Frame story interludes per bible
- [ ] All major plot threads resolved

### Ideal Target (Full Vision)
- [ ] 300,000-350,000 words
- [ ] 65-70 chapters
- [ ] All bible elements present
- [ ] Every chapter 4,000+ words average
- [ ] Sensory richness throughout
- [ ] Unreliable narrator moments every 10 chapters
- [ ] Multiple "texture" chapters (no plot advancement, pure character)
- [ ] Story-within-story for Lanre arc
- [ ] Full Adem return sequence
- [ ] Ending earns its hope through devastating cost
- [ ] Frame story could stand alone as novella

### Quality Benchmarks

**Density Test**: Pick any random chapter. Does it have:
- [ ] At least 3 distinct scenes?
- [ ] Dialogue that reveals character, not just information?
- [ ] A moment of humor or levity?
- [ ] A moment of dread or tension?
- [ ] Sensory details in every scene?

**Rothfuss Test**: Read a chapter from WMF, then read a chapter from this draft. Can you tell which is which within 2 paragraphs? If yes, more revision needed.

**Emotional Test**: Does the reader DREAD reaching the Renere Ball because they know what's coming? If not, not enough investment built.
