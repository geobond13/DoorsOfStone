# The Doors of Stone: Style Guide

This document defines the voice, prose patterns, and stylistic conventions for maintaining consistency with Patrick Rothfuss's writing style.

## Core Prose Characteristics

### 1. Lyrical, Musical Quality

The prose should feel musical and poetic, mirroring Kvothe's love of music.

**Techniques:**
- Varied sentence lengths create rhythm—short punchy sentences followed by longer, flowing ones
- Subtle alliteration and assonance without being overt
- The "Three Silences" motif for atmosphere through absence

### 2. First-Person Unreliable Narrator

Kvothe tells his own story, and readers should question what they're told.

**Include:**
- Moments where Kvothe catches himself or redirects
- Acknowledgment that he's shaping the narrative
- Discrepancies between Kvothe's self-assessment and actions
- Kote's comments hinting at embellishment or selective memory

### 3. Sensory Immersion

Ground magic and wonder in physical sensation.

**Every scene should engage at least two senses beyond sight:**
- Temperature changes with sympathy
- Textures (skin, cloth, wood)
- Smells (selas, coalsmoke, old books, copper, cinnamon)
- Weight and presence of objects

### 4. Nested Stories

Stories-within-stories serve dual purposes: world-building AND foreshadowing.

Each nested narrative should echo themes from Kvothe's life.

### 5. Balance Beautiful and Real

Purple prose in emotional moments, restrained prose in action sequences.

If prose gets "too beautiful," it becomes distracting. The goal is immersion, not showing off.

### 6. Meander with Purpose

If a section feels slow, ensure it's doing at least two jobs:
- Character work + world-building
- Relationship development + foreshadowing

## Sentence Rhythms

**Short declarative followed by long flowing:**
> "It was. It simply was, the way the sky is, the way stone is."

**Tricolon (rule of three):**
> "He was young. He was clever. He was utterly alone."

**Fragments for emphasis:**
> "Cold. Dark. Waiting."

## Vocabulary Anchors

### Use These
- fortnight, span
- talent, jot, dreg (currency)
- Tehlu, Alar, binder, scriv
- Taborlin, Lanre, Chandrian

### Avoid These
- okay, guys, stuff
- things (when vague)
- literally (modern emphasis)
- Modern slang or idioms

---

## Sensory Anchors

### Smell
- Coalsmoke, selas flowers, old books
- Copper (magic), cinnamon (Devi's room)
- Blood, iron, rain on stone

### Touch
- Cold stone, rough wool, smooth wood
- The weight of a lute in hand
- Felurian's impossible softness

### Sound
- The absence of sound (silence motif)
- Wind, crackling fire, distant bells
- Music—always music

---

## Emotional Expression

### Do This
Show emotion through:
- Physical sensation ("My chest tightened")
- Action ("My hands found the lute strings without thought")
- Deflection ("I laughed, though nothing was funny")

### Avoid This
- Direct statement ("I felt sad")
- Modern psychology ("I was triggered")
- Over-explanation ("This reminded me of my trauma because...")

## Dialogue Characteristics

### Kvothe & Friends (Sim, Wilem)
- Witty banter, academic in-jokes
- Sim: warm, emotional, protective
- Wilem: dry, practical, Cealdish formality

### Denna
- Playful, evasive conversational style
- Sharp when cornered
- Never says exactly what she means

### Elodin
- Cryptic, mercurial
- Drops profundity casually then deflects
- Socratic—answers questions with questions

### Fae Beings
- Formal, archaic speech patterns
- Dangerous playfulness
- Time means nothing to them

### Kote (Frame Story)
- Weary, precise, occasionally bitter
- Flashes of the old fire
- Long silences

### Bast
- Playful but dangerous
- Protective of Reshi
- Archaic patterns when emotional

## The Silence of Three Parts

Always available for endings. The signature:

1. **The quiet of things absent** - sound, life, noise
2. **The weight of things present** - stone, dust, grief
3. **The silence that belongs to one person** - Kvothe/Kote, cut-flower sound, waiting to die

---

## Chapter Naming Conventions

**Effective patterns:**
- Single-word abstract: "Cinder", "Missing", "Lockless"
- Phrase with weight: "The Weight of Silence", "A Silence of Three Parts"
- Poetic/ironic: "Once King, Always King"
- Action implied: "The Fall", "The Deceit"

**Avoid:**
- Spoiling content ("Kvothe Kills the King")
- Too generic ("Chapter 12")
- Too cute or modern

**Rule:** Each title should work as a phrase Kvothe might say. It should resonate differently before and after reading the chapter.

## Voice Drift Check

Every 5-10 chapters, review against these patterns:
- [ ] Sentences have varied rhythm (not all same length)
- [ ] At least two senses per scene
- [ ] No modern slang or idioms
- [ ] Emotion shown through action, not stated
- [ ] Dialogue matches character voice profiles
- [ ] Frame story intrusions maintain Kote's weariness
