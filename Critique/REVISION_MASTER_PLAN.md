## SEQUEL HOOKS TO PRESERVE

| Hook | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| The War | End with Kvothe walking toward it, outcome unknown |
| Denna's Freedom | Seals can evolve/weaken; "almost" communication |
| Six Remaining Chandrian | Mention they're still active |
| Missing Power Fragment | One piece remains locked/lost |
| Bast's Binding | Leave unresolved |
| Cthaeh's Long Game | Hint this was all according to plan |

---

## ENDING DIRECTION

The epilogue must convey:
- **Not victory, but willingness to continue**
- **Not reunion, but enduring connection**
- **Not restoration, but transformation**
- **Not "The End", but "To Be Continued"**

Key image: A man who is neither fully Kvothe nor Kote—something new, walking toward an uncertain future with silence as his companion and love as his anchor.
