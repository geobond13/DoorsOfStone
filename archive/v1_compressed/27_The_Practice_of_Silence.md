ELODIN ARRIVED ON the seventh day.

I don't know how the Amyr contacted him. I don't know what promises they made or what threats they implied. But one morning I woke to find him sitting in my chambers, eating an apple with the casual indifference of someone who had broken into a dozen locked rooms to get there.

"You've been practicing without me," he said. "I can tell. There's a... residue."

"I didn't know how to contact you."

"You didn't try." He took another bite, chewed thoughtfully. "Which is probably wise. The roads are watched these days. Letters intercepted. The wrong message to the wrong person could end very badly."

"How did you get here?"

"I walked." He smiled at my expression. "Not the whole way, of course. There are paths between places, if you know how to find them. Shortcuts that most people don't see."

"The Fae?"

"Among other things." He finished the apple, set the core on my nightstand with deliberate care. "But we're not here to discuss my travel arrangements. We're here because you've been trying to speak the name of silence without guidance, and that's roughly as sensible as juggling live coals while blindfolded."

"The Amyr said I need to learn control."

"The Amyr are politicians. They understand leverage and sacrifice and acceptable losses." His voice hardened. "They don't understand naming. They don't understand what happens when you try to force a name to do something it doesn't want to do."

"What happens?"

"The name wins." He stood, walked to the window, looked out at the Maer's gardens below. "Always. Without exception. You cannot control silence, Kvothe. You can only... negotiate with it."

We trained in the old wing of the estate.

The same wing where I'd met the Amyr, but different rooms. Chambers lined with lead and copper, warded with symbols I didn't recognize. Places designed to contain things that didn't want to be contained.

"The name of silence isn't like other names," Elodin explained, on our first day. "Wind. Fire. Stone. These are names of things that exist—substances, forces, patterns in the world. You speak them, and the thing responds, because you're speaking its nature."

"And silence?"

"Silence is the absence of things. The negative space. The void that exists between sounds, between heartbeats, between thoughts." He gestured at the empty room around us. "You can't control absence. You can only... invite it."

"How?"

"By becoming it. Temporarily. Completely." He sat cross-legged on the floor, motioned for me to do the same. "Close your eyes. Listen."

I closed my eyes. Listened.

At first, I heard everything—my heartbeat, my breathing, the distant sounds of the estate, the wind against the walls. Layer upon layer of sound, filling the world.

"Now go deeper," Elodin said. "Past the sounds. Into the spaces between them."

I tried. Focused on the gaps. The moments of quiet between each heartbeat. The tiny silences that existed everywhere, unnoticed.

And something stirred.

Not a sound—the opposite of a sound. A presence that felt like absence. A weight that had no substance.

"There," Elodin whispered. "You feel it. The true silence. The one that exists beneath everything."

"It's... cold."

"It's nothing. Literally nothing. And nothing is always cold, because warmth requires something to be warm." His voice was very soft. "Now. Don't try to grab it. Don't try to control it. Just... acknowledge it. Let it know you see it."

I reached out—not with my hands, but with something deeper. The sleeping mind. The part of me that saw names without looking.

The silence reached back.

For a moment—just a moment—the world went absolutely still. Not quiet. *Void*. An emptiness so complete that I forgot what sound had felt like.

Then it released me, and I gasped like a drowning man breaking the surface.

"Good," Elodin said. "That's the first step."

"I thought I was going to die."

"You were, for about half a second. The silence was deciding whether to let you go." He smiled grimly. "It decided yes. This time."

---

The days blurred together.

Morning: meditation. Learning to find the silence without losing myself in it. Building the mental calluses that would let me touch the void without being consumed.

Afternoon: practice. Speaking fragments of the name. Feeling the world go quiet, then pulling back before the quiet became permanent. Walking the edge of a cliff without falling.

Evening: collapse. The exhaustion of working with silence was unlike anything I'd experienced. Not physical tiredness—something deeper. A weariness of the soul, as if each contact with the void took something from me that couldn't be replaced.

"You're losing yourself," Elodin said, on the twelfth day. "I can see it. The edges are getting fuzzy."

"I'm fine."

"You're not." He handed me a mirror. "Look."

I looked. And I saw what he meant.

My eyes had always been green. But now there were specks of... something else. Darkness, like flecks of ash, scattered through the irises. And my face—was it thinner? Paler? Something had changed, though I couldn't say exactly what.

"The silence is marking you," Elodin said quietly. "It does that, to the people who speak it. Takes a little piece each time. Leaves a little of itself behind."

"The seven namers who spoke it before me. The ones you said were remembered as monsters."

"They weren't monsters when they started. But they spoke the name too often. Let it take too much. Eventually, there wasn't enough of them left to remember what they'd been." He took the mirror back. "You need to be careful, Kvothe. There's a limit to how many times you can touch the void before the void touches back."

"I have less than two weeks. The song—"

"I know about the song." His voice was sharp. "I know about the stakes. I know about the girl and the binding and the doors. But none of it matters if you destroy yourself before you can use what you're learning."

"Then teach me faster."

"I can't teach faster. The silence doesn't care about our schedules. It will take as long as it takes." He sighed, suddenly looking every one of his years. "This is why the Amyr don't understand naming. They think it's a skill, like swordplay or rhetoric. Something that can be mastered with enough practice."

"It's not?"

"It's a relationship. And relationships take time. Trust. Mutual understanding." He gestured at my shadowed eyes. "The silence is learning you, Kvothe. Just as you're learning it. And right now, it's not sure if it wants to be your tool or your tomb."

On the fifteenth day, something changed.

I was deep in meditation, touching the silence the way Elodin had taught me—gently, respectfully, like approaching a wild animal. Feeling its cold presence, its vast emptiness.

And suddenly, I understood.

The silence wasn't a force to be controlled. It wasn't a weapon to be wielded. It was a door.

A door that led to the place where sounds went when they ended. Where thoughts dissolved. Where everything eventually went, in the fullness of time.

And doors could be opened. Doors could be closed.

The name of silence wasn't about making things quiet.

It was about choosing what passed through the door.

I opened my eyes. Elodin was watching me, his expression unreadable.

"You see it now," he said. Not a question.

"It's not destruction. It's selection. Letting some sounds through, blocking others. Choosing what gets to exist and what gets..."

"Unmade." He nodded slowly. "The seven namers who spoke the name—most of them used it like a weapon. Blunt, indiscriminate. They silenced everything, including themselves."

"But if I could be precise—"

"You could silence a single voice. A single song. Without affecting anything else." He stood, brushed off his robes. "That's what the Amyr are hoping for. That's why they brought me here, despite the risks."

"Can I do it?"

"I don't know." He moved toward the door. "But we have three days to find out. So I suggest you stop asking questions and start practicing."

"Three days," Chronicler said. "That's when you learned to be precise?"

"That's when I learned what precision meant. Whether I was actually capable of it..." The innkeeper shook his head. "I didn't know until Renere. Until the moment I spoke the name and watched Denna fall."

"But you stopped the song."

"I stopped the song." His voice was hollow. "I was precise enough for that. Just not precise enough to realize that Denna and the song had become the same thing. That silencing one meant silencing both."

"The bindings in her hair."

"Cinder's final trap. He'd woven Denna so deeply into the music that she couldn't exist without it. When I took the song, I took her voice. Her breath. Her heartbeat." He picked up his cloth again. "I was precise. Just not precise enough. And the difference was everything."

"Do you think you could have saved her? If you'd had more time?"

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment.

"I think about that every day," he said finally. "Every hour. What if I'd started training sooner. What if Elodin had pushed harder. What if I'd understood the binding before it was too late."

"And what do you conclude?"

"That 'what if' is the cruelest phrase in any language." He set down the cloth. "The past is fixed. The choices are made. And all the precision in the world can't bring back the people we've lost."
