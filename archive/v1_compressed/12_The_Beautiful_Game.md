THE PALACE BLAZED with light.

A thousand candles. Ten thousand candles. Crystal chandeliers caught the flame and scattered it like captured stars, filling the grand ballroom with a radiance that seemed to push back the darkness gathering outside. Music swelled from an orchestra in the gallery—something bright and celebratory, the kind of piece that made you believe the world was still a place for joy.

I moved through the crowd like a ghost.

Getting in had been easier than I expected. A borrowed nobleman's coat, a confident stride, a name dropped to the right servant—and I was inside, another face among hundreds. The cream of Vintas society swirled around me, their jewels glittering, their laughter ringing hollow in my ears.

I wasn't looking at them. I was looking for him.

Cinder could be anyone. That was the problem. He could have worn any face, any form. The white hair and black eyes of my nightmares might be hidden behind glamourie, or changed entirely through means I couldn't imagine. I searched the crowd for something else—a feeling, a wrongness, the chill that I remembered from that night by the fire.

And there was Denna.

She stood near the dais where the King would soon appear, dressed in that same dark blue gown with its strange silver embroidery. Her hair was up tonight, twisted into elaborate patterns that might have been decorative or might have been something else entirely. The inscriptions on her skin were hidden beneath her sleeves, but I could feel them from across the room—a pulse of magic, steady and growing.

She was ready.

I started toward her. Then stopped.

Because I saw him.

---

He stood beside a pillar, half-hidden in shadow, watching the crowd with an expression of patient amusement. An older man—distinguished, white-haired, dressed in the rich but understated clothes of a minor noble. His walking stick rested against his shoulder, familiar and terrible.

Not Bredon. This was someone else wearing a similar shape. Someone who moved with the cold grace of winter, whose smile never reached his eyes.

Cinder.

I knew it was him. Knew it in my bones, in my blood, in the part of me that had never stopped burning since the night he killed my parents. The glamourie was good—better than good—but underneath it I could sense the truth. Ice wrapped in flesh. Murder wearing a human face.

He saw me looking. His smile widened.

Then he turned away, disappearing into the crowd, and I lost him.

---

"Kvothe."

Denna's voice, low and urgent. She'd crossed the room while I was distracted, appearing at my elbow like she'd materialized from the shadows.

"I saw him," I said. "By the eastern pillar. White hair, walking stick—"

"I know what he looks like." Her hand gripped my arm, tight enough to bruise. "You can't confront him here. Not yet. Not until—"

"Until what? Until you finish his song? Until the binding breaks?"

"Until I have a chance to—" She stopped, her eyes going wide. "He's moving."

I followed her gaze. The crowd was parting, flowing aside like water around a stone. The King was coming.

King Roderic Calanthis was everything I'd expected and nothing like I'd imagined. Tall, broad-shouldered, with the confident bearing of a man born to command. He moved through his court with practiced ease, accepting bows and curtsies, exchanging words with favored nobles. Beside him walked a young woman in white—the Jakis girl, his bride-to-be. Ambrose's sister, though she looked nothing like him. Softer. Kinder. Unaware of the web she'd been caught in.

The King mounted the dais. The orchestra fell silent. Every eye in the room turned toward him.

"My friends," he said. His voice carried easily, filling the ballroom without effort. "We gather tonight to celebrate not just an engagement, but a hope. A hope for peace. A hope for unity. A hope that our kingdom can weather the storms ahead and emerge stronger."

Murmurs of approval rippled through the crowd. Polite applause.

"I know these are difficult times." The King's expression grew serious. "I know there are shadows on our borders, troubles in our villages, whispers of things that should not be. But tonight, we set those fears aside. Tonight, we remind ourselves what we're fighting for."

He extended his hand toward his bride-to-be. She stepped forward, taking his arm, and the applause grew louder.

"And now," the King said, "we will have music. A new song, composed in honor of this occasion. A reminder that even in darkness, beauty endures."

He gestured toward the gallery. Toward—

*No.*

Denna stepped forward from the crowd.

She climbed the steps to the gallery, her gown trailing behind her like shadow given form. The musicians shifted to make room for her, their expressions puzzled but polite. She didn't look at me as she passed.

She didn't look at anyone at all.

---

The first notes were beautiful.

I'd heard Denna sing before, of course. Countless times, in countless places. But this was different. This was the song she'd been building toward her entire life—every lesson, every practice, every moment of suffering distilled into pure, crystalline sound.

The ballroom fell silent. Not the polite silence of an audience, but something deeper. Something *compelled*. I saw nobles freeze mid-conversation, their glasses halfway to their lips. I saw servants stop in their tracks, their trays forgotten. I saw the King himself go still, his eyes fixed on Denna with an expression of wonder.

And I felt the magic begin to move.

It was subtle at first—a pressure in the air, a shift in the light. But as Denna's voice rose, the power grew. The inscriptions on her skin began to glow, visible even through her sleeves, pulsing in time with the melody. The silver embroidery on her dress caught the light and reflected it strangely, forming patterns that hurt to look at.

The song was about Lanre. I recognized fragments of it from the Eolian—the tale of a hero, a love, a fall. But this version was different. Fuller. *Complete*. And as she sang, I felt the story taking shape around us.

Not just telling. *Becoming*.

"He was a lord of noble heart," Denna sang, "whose love burned brighter than the sun. But shadows crept from every part, and tragedy could not be undone..."

The Chandrian. She was singing about the Chandrian. But not as monsters—as victims. As heroes who had sacrificed everything to hold back a greater darkness. As martyrs who deserved not hatred, but gratitude.

And the audience was *believing* it.

I could see the change happening in real time. Eyes that had held suspicion now shone with sympathy. Faces that would have twisted in horror at the mention of the Seven now wore expressions of profound sadness. The song was rewriting their understanding, restructuring their knowledge, replacing three thousand years of truth with beautiful, seductive lies.

And somewhere in the crowd, Cinder watched. And smiled.

---

I pushed through the crowd.

People didn't want to move—the song held them in place, transfixed by Denna's voice. But I'd studied the Ketan. I knew how to flow through a crowd without breaking it, how to slip between bodies that didn't want to give way.

I reached the dais. Mounted the steps. The King's guards started to move toward me, but they were slow—caught in the song's web like everyone else.

Denna saw me coming. Her voice didn't waver, but something flickered in her eyes. Fear. Hope. Resignation.

I grabbed her arm.

"Stop," I hissed. "Denna, you have to stop—"

"I can't." The words came out between verses, barely audible. "The inscriptions—they won't let me—"

The song swelled around us, louder than ever. I felt the magic pressing against my mind, trying to change what I knew, trying to make me believe the beautiful lies she was singing. But I'd seen the Chandrian with my own eyes. I'd watched them murder my parents. No song, no matter how beautiful, could make me forget that.

And then I saw him again.

Cinder. Standing at the edge of the dais, his glamourie flickering. For just a moment, I saw his true face—the pale skin, the black eyes, the smile that had haunted my nightmares for years.

He was *enjoying* this.

"Ferule," I said.

The name came out before I could stop it. Not spoken—*Named*. The deep name, the true name, pulled from somewhere in my sleeping mind and given voice.

Cinder staggered. His glamourie shattered, revealing the monster beneath. Screams erupted from the crowd—real screams now, not the polite gasps of scandalized nobility but the raw terror of people seeing something that shouldn't exist.

The guards finally moved. Drew their swords. Stepped toward the creature that had appeared among them.

And Cinder laughed.

"Clever boy," he said. His voice was ice given sound. "But not clever enough. The song is almost complete. The binding is almost broken. And nothing you do can stop it now."

He gestured toward Denna. Her voice rose to a crescendo, the final verse building toward its conclusion. The magic was almost finished—I could feel it reaching toward something vast and ancient, preparing to crack open a seal that had held for three thousand years.

I had to stop her. Had to stop the song. Had to find a way to silence the magic before it was too late.

But Denna was the song. The inscriptions in her skin were part of it, woven so deeply into the magic that there was no separating them.

To silence the song was to silence *her*.

---

The King stepped forward.

Roderic Calanthis, the most powerful man in Vintas, moving to protect his people from the monster in their midst. His hand went to his sword—a ceremonial blade, but steel nonetheless.

"Guards," he commanded. "Kill that creature."

The guards charged. Cinder didn't move. He just smiled as the first blade swung toward him—

—and stopped.

The guard froze, his sword hanging in mid-air. Then he collapsed, clutching his chest, his heart stopped by magic older than the kingdom he'd sworn to defend.

More guards fell. Nobles screamed and fled. Chaos erupted across the ballroom as centuries of decorum shattered in an instant.

And through it all, Denna sang.

The final verse. The completion. The moment when everything would change.

I had one chance. One desperate, terrible chance.

I opened my mouth.

And I spoke the Name of Silence.
