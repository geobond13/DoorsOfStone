THE LETTER ARRIVED sealed in black wax.

Not the Maer's seal—something older. A symbol I'd seen in the restricted Archives, in the books Lorren had shown me. A tower, broken, with flame spilling from the cracks.

I opened it in private, my hands steady despite the pounding in my chest.

*To the one who asks too many questions:*

*You have been noticed. You have been measured. And you have been found... promising.*

*Come to the Obsidian Hall at midnight. Come alone. Come prepared to choose a side.*

*The doors are cracking. The time for neutrality has passed.*

There was no signature. No mark beyond the seal. But I knew who had sent it.

The Amyr.

---

The Obsidian Hall was buried in the oldest part of the Maer's estate—a wing that had been sealed for generations, supposedly due to structural damage. But the locks on the doors were new, and the dust on the floor showed recent footprints.

I followed them down.

Past crumbling staircases. Through corridors where the walls were carved with scenes I didn't recognize—battles, bindings, figures with flames for eyes. Into a chamber that shouldn't have existed, lit by lamps that burned without oil.

Three figures waited for me.

Lorren. The Master Archivist, his face as blank as always.

Bredon. The old player, leaning on his walking stick, his eyes sharp despite his age.

And a third figure I didn't recognize—a woman in grey robes, her face hidden by a deep hood. But something about her stance, her presence, felt familiar. Ancient.

"You came," Lorren said. "I wasn't certain you would."

"You didn't give me much choice."

"There's always a choice." Bredon smiled. "That's rather the point. We needed to see which choice you'd make."

"And if I'd chosen not to come?"

"Then we would have known something about your character." The hooded woman's voice was like whispered parchment. "And we would have made different arrangements."

I looked around the chamber. At the obsidian walls, smooth as mirrors. At the floor, carved with patterns that hurt to look at directly.

"What is this place?"

"A meeting room," Lorren said. "One of many, scattered across the Four Corners. The Amyr used to gather here, in the days when we could operate openly."

"The Amyr are disbanded. The church dissolved them centuries ago."

"The church *pretended* to dissolve them." Bredon moved to a chair, settled himself with a sigh. "It was easier that way. Fewer questions. Fewer investigations. We could work more effectively from the shadows."

"We?"

"We." The hooded woman pushed back her cowl, and I saw her face—ancient, lined, but with eyes that held the weight of centuries. "I am Tehlu's last Ciridae. The blood-right passes through me. And through me, to everyone who serves the greater good."

I recognized her now. Not her face—I'd never seen it—but her presence. The same weight I'd felt in Lorren's office. The same ancient certainty.

"You're the one who's been pruning the Archives."

"I'm the one who decides what the world is ready to know." She smiled, and it wasn't a pleasant smile. "You've been asking about the Chandrian. About the doors. About the truth that's been hidden for three thousand years."

"I want to understand."

"Understanding is dangerous. Understanding leads to questions, and questions lead to actions, and actions lead to consequences that ripple across centuries." She gestured at the walls around us. "Every piece of knowledge in this chamber is a weapon. A bomb waiting to explode. We choose very carefully who gets access."

"And you're choosing to give me access?"

"We're choosing to give you context." Lorren stepped forward. "You're already in the middle of this, Kvothe. The Cthaeh made sure of that. Your parents' research. Your connection to Denna. The name of silence sleeping in your mind. You're a piece on the board whether you want to be or not."

"So help me be the right kind of piece."

"That's the question, isn't it?" Bredon drummed his fingers on his walking stick. "What kind of piece are you? A pawn, to be sacrificed for larger gains? A knight, to be aimed at specific targets? Or something else entirely?"

"What else is there?"

The three of them exchanged glances. A conversation without words, conducted in the space of heartbeats.

"A maker," the old woman said finally. "Someone who doesn't just move on the board, but shapes it. Changes the rules. Redefines what's possible."

"Is that what you want me to be?"

"That's what we're afraid you might become." Her voice was very quiet. "The last maker broke the world. Shattered the moon. Created the Chandrian. Are you prepared to carry that weight? That responsibility?"

I thought of my parents. Of Denna. Of the name of silence, stirring in the depths of my sleeping mind.

"I don't want to break anything," I said. "I want to understand. And then I want to stop the people who are trying to make things worse."

"Cinder."

"Cinder." The name tasted like poison on my tongue. "He's controlling Denna. Writing a song that will—do something. Change the binding somehow."

"The binding that holds the doors closed," Lorren said. "The binding that keeps the Chandrian anchored to this world. If Cinder succeeds—"

"The binding shifts to him," Bredon finished. "Instead of Haliax at the center, holding everything together, Cinder takes control. And unlike Haliax, who's spent millennia trying to maintain the seal..."

"Cinder wants to break it."

"Cinder wants to use what's behind it." The old woman's voice was grave. "Power beyond imagining. The stuff of creation itself, raw and uncontrolled. He could remake reality. Become a god. Tear down everything that's been built since the Creation War."

"Then help me stop him."

"We can't." Lorren's voice was heavy with frustration. "The Amyr act through influence, through careful manipulation, through the removal of dangerous knowledge. We're not equipped for direct confrontation."

"But you are," Bredon said, and there was something hungry in his eyes. "You have the name of silence. The unmaking word. If you could learn to control it—truly control it—you might be the only weapon that could stop Cinder."

"The only weapon?"

"Silence ends all songs." The old woman rose, approached me. "Including the one Denna is writing. Including the binding that holds the Chandrian together. Including..."

"Including Denna herself."

The words hung in the air between us.

"The choice is yours," Lorren said quietly. "We can teach you to control the name. To wield it precisely, surgically. To cut out the cancer without killing the patient."

"Or?"

"Or you can walk away. Pretend this conversation never happened. Let events unfold as they will." Bredon's voice was gentle. "But if you choose that path, you should know—Cinder will succeed. The doors will open. And everyone you love will die in the chaos that follows."

I looked at the three of them. At the weight of centuries in their eyes. At the impossible choice they were offering.

"How long do I have to decide?"

"The song will be performed at the Renere ball. Three weeks from now." The old woman replaced her hood. "By then, you need to be ready. One way or another."

She turned and walked into the shadows. Bredon followed, leaning on his stick.

Lorren lingered for a moment longer.

"For what it's worth," he said, "I hope you choose to fight. The world needs people who ask questions. Who refuse to accept the darkness."

He left me alone in the obsidian chamber, surrounded by weapons I didn't know how to use.

"Three weeks," Chronicler said. "That's how long you had to prepare."

"Three weeks to learn control over a power that had broken every namer who'd wielded it. Three weeks to find a way to save Denna without destroying her." The innkeeper laughed, and there was no humor in it. "The Amyr are not known for their generous timelines."

"But you did it. You learned to control the name."

"I learned to *direct* it. Control is a strong word." He picked up a glass, held it to the light. "The name of silence is not a tool. It's a force of nature. You don't control a hurricane—you just point it at something and hope you survive the aftermath."

"And at Renere? When you spoke it?"

"At Renere, I pointed it at the only target I could see. The song that was about to crack the world open." The glass went still in his hands. "I didn't realize—couldn't have realized—that Denna was so thoroughly bound to the song that stopping one meant stopping the other."

"You killed her."

"I silenced her." His voice broke. "Forever. Without meaning to. Without understanding what I was doing until it was already done."

He set down the glass.

"That's the lesson the Amyr never taught me. That's the thing they didn't mention when they offered me their weapons." He looked up, and his eyes were ancient. "Power without wisdom isn't just dangerous. It's murder, wearing a hero's face."
