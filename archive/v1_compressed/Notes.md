# Author Notes

This document tracks decisions, rationale, and open questions about the story.

## Major Plot Decisions

### Why Denna Dies
- Creates genuine tragedy rather than bittersweet reunion
- Kvothe's "clever solution" (Name of Silence) kills what he loves
- Explains his complete withdrawal in frame story
- Subverts expectations - he doesn't save her

### Why Bredon is Amyr, Not Cinder
- Misdirection payoff - readers expect Bredon = Ash
- Creates genuine twist while Master Ash = Cinder still works
- Allows Amyr revelation to come from unexpected ally
- Bredon's "beautiful game" becomes larger metaphor

### The Calanthis Line as Living Locks
- Explains why killing the king matters cosmically
- Connects regicide to Doors of Stone
- Makes Kvothe's carelessness catastrophic, not just political
- Ties bloodlines to magic (consistent with Lackless connection)

### Cinder as Renegade
- Prevents Chandrian from being monolithic villains
- Creates internal conflict that Kvothe exploits/triggers
- Explains Haliax's frustration with Cinder in WMF
- Makes the situation more complex than "kill the bad guy"

## Open Questions

- [ ] Exact nature of what's behind the Doors of Stone
- [ ] How literally to treat the princess Ariel = Auri theory
- [ ] Whether Sim/Fela survive or become collateral damage
- [ ] The angel Kvothe speaks to - who/what?
- [ ] Bast's exact origin and how he found Kvothe

## Theories Integrated

| Theory | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Kvothe's mother = Netalia Lackless | Used | Confirmed via Meluan |
| Master Ash = Cinder | Used | With renegade twist |
| Kote = name-locked Kvothe | Used | VH removed, in chest |
| Auri = Princess Ariel | Likely | TBD exact implementation |
| Bredon = Cinder | Subverted | Bredon is Amyr instead |

## Lessons Applied

From "The Price of Remembering":
- Devi as major player, not cameo
- Frame interludes at emotional peaks
- Physical mystery objects for investigation
- Wilderness/introspection beats for character depth
- Avoid voice drift in later chapters
