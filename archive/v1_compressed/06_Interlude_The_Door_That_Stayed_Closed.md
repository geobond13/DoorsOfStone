THE TELLING PAUSED.

Outside the Waystone Inn, the morning had turned grey and heavy, clouds gathering on the horizon like armies massing for battle. The fire in the hearth had burned down to embers, and neither Bast nor Chronicler moved to stoke it.

The innkeeper stood behind the bar, his hands flat on the wood. He hadn't moved in what felt like hours. His eyes stared at something none of them could see—a rooftop years distant, a night that wouldn't come again.

"You knew," Chronicler said finally. His pen hovered over the page, uncertain. "Even then. You knew something was wrong."

"I knew everything was wrong." The innkeeper's voice was hollow, empty of its earlier energy. "I just thought I was the one who could fix it."

He laughed—a single, broken sound that held no humor at all.

"That's always been my problem, hasn't it? Thinking I'm the one who can fix things. Thinking that if I'm just clever enough, quick enough, *good* enough, I can solve any puzzle. Save any day." He shook his head slowly. "But some problems aren't puzzles. Some things can't be solved. They can only be survived."

Bast moved from his place by the window, coming to stand on the other side of the bar. His face was pale in the grey light, his eyes bright with something that might have been unshed tears.

"Reshi," he said softly. "It wasn't your fault. She made her own choices—"

"Did she?" The innkeeper looked up, and there was something terrible in his gaze. Something that had been there all along, hiding beneath the surface. "Or did I make them for her? Every time I pushed, every time I demanded answers she couldn't give—I was closing the door. Brick by brick. Until there was nothing left but a wall."

"She loved you."

"Yes." The word came out like a confession. Like a wound. "She loved me. And I loved her. And we destroyed each other anyway, because neither of us knew how to love without breaking."

Silence filled the room. The kind of silence that feels like weight, like pressure, like the moment before a storm breaks.

"This is where I should have stopped," the innkeeper said. His voice had gone quiet, reflective—an old man telling stories by a dying fire. "Right here. At the rooftop. At Auri's warning. I should have stopped trying to *save* her and started trying to *be* with her. Whatever that meant. However long she'd let me."

He lifted one hand from the bar, looked at it. Turned it over in the grey light, studying the lines on his palm like they held secrets he'd forgotten how to read.

"I should have asked instead of accused. Listened instead of lectured. Let her have her secrets, even the ones that terrified me." He set his hand back down. "But I was too clever to be wise. Too proud to be kind. Too young to understand that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is nothing at all."

Chronicler set down his pen. His hand was trembling slightly.

"What happened next?" he asked.

The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment. Then he reached beneath the bar and pulled out a bottle—something old and amber, with a label too faded to read. He poured three glasses, slid two across the bar toward Bast and Chronicler.

"The Maer sent for me," he said. "Word came that he was dying, and there were things he needed to show me before the end." He lifted his glass, studied the liquid within. "So I left. I went to Vintas, because that's what clever young men do when they're offered power and purpose. They run toward it."

"And Denna?"

"I left her behind. I told myself I'd come back. That there would be time later, after I'd dealt with whatever the Maer wanted. After I'd solved that problem too."

He drank. Deeply. Set the empty glass on the bar.

"There wasn't time," he said. "There never is. And by the time I understood that, the door was closed. The only door that ever mattered."

Bast's hand moved across the bar, covering the innkeeper's. The touch seemed to startle him—a flicker of surprise in those empty eyes.

"Reshi," Bast said. "You have to finish the story."

"I know."

"Not just for the Chronicler. For you." His voice was urgent now, desperate. "You've been carrying this alone for too long. Let it out. Let it *go*."

The innkeeper looked at his student. At his friend. At the only person in the world who still called him by a name that meant something.

"I will," he said. "I'll tell you everything. The Maer's court. The Lackless door. The truth about the Amyr and the lies I believed." He pulled his hand back, reached for the bottle. "And then I'll tell you about Renere. About the King. About the Name of Silence and the breath I stopped."

He poured another drink. Didn't touch it.

"But first," he said quietly, "I need you to understand something. Everything that happened next—every choice I made, every mistake, every tragedy—it all came from here. From this moment. From the door I was too proud to walk through."

He looked out the window, at the grey sky and the gathering storm.

"Remember that," he said. "When you hear what I did. Remember that I could have stopped. I could have chosen differently. I could have been kind instead of clever."

He turned back to them. His eyes were red.

"And I wasn't."
