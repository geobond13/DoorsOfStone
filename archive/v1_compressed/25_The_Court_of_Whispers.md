THE MAER'S COURT was a nest of vipers wearing silk.

I'd been back in Severen for three days before I understood the shape of things. The power had shifted while I was gone—subtly, but unmistakably. Alveron still sat on his throne, still commanded loyalty from his vassals. But there were new whispers now. New alliances forming in the shadows.

And at the center of it all, like a spider in a web of golden thread, was Caudicus.

Not the Caudicus I'd exposed as a poisoner. He was long dead, executed for his crimes against the Maer. This was his replacement—a woman named Hespe Vandel, thin as a blade and twice as sharp. She mixed the Maer's medicines now, tended his failing health, listened to his confidences.

And she watched me with eyes that saw too much.

"You've made enemies," Stapes told me on my third night. We were in his chambers, sharing wine that cost more than my entire tuition at the University. "The kind that don't forget. The kind that plan."

"What kind of enemies?"

"The Jakis influence reaches further than you know. Ambrose's father has been whispering in certain ears. Suggesting that the young man the Maer trusts so implicitly might not be quite as loyal as he seems."

"That's absurd. I saved the Maer's life."

"And that's precisely the problem." Stapes refilled my glass. "You know too much. You've been too useful. Men like that are dangerous, because they can never truly be controlled."

"So they want to control me?"

"They want to remove you. Or turn you. Or destroy your reputation so thoroughly that no one will believe anything you say." He leaned forward. "Be careful, Kvothe. The game at court is different from the games you're used to. Here, the pieces smile while they're being sacrificed."

I spent the next week learning the board.

The Maer's court was divided into factions—visible alliances and invisible ones, overlapping in ways that made my head spin. There were the traditionalists, who wanted things to stay as they'd always been. The progressives, who saw opportunity in the coming changes. And somewhere in between, the pragmatists who would side with whoever seemed most likely to win.

Bredon helped me navigate. He always did.

"You're thinking too small," he said one afternoon, as we played tak in his private chambers. "You see the court as the game. But the court is just one board among many."

"What are the other boards?"

"Commerce. Religion. The University. The Fae." He moved a piece—a subtle gambit I didn't recognize. "All of them interconnected. All of them affecting each other in ways that most players don't see."

"And you see them?"

"I've been playing a very long time." He smiled, and there was something ancient in his eyes. "Long enough to recognize when a new player enters the game. Someone who might change the shape of things."

"Me?"

"Perhaps. Or perhaps the girl you're so worried about." He moved another piece. "She's been busy, you know. While you've been learning court politics, she's been learning something else entirely."

"What?"

"Ask her, when you see her next." He captured one of my stones. "If you can bring yourself to ask the right questions."

I found Denna in the gardens that night.

She was sitting by the fountain, watching the moonlight play on the water. Her hair was longer than I remembered, falling past her shoulders in waves that caught the light. And in those waves—

The braids. More of them now. More intricate. The Yllish patterns I'd learned to recognize, woven into the darkness like hidden messages.

"You've been avoiding me," she said, without turning around.

"I've been... busy."

"Busy learning the game." She finally looked at me, and her eyes were sad. "Bredon's been teaching you. I can tell. You have that look—the one people get when they start seeing patterns everywhere."

"What look do you have?"

She laughed—bitter, soft. "The look of someone who's been inside the pattern so long they've forgotten what it was like to see it from outside."

I sat beside her. Close enough to feel the warmth of her presence. Not close enough to touch.

"Tell me about your patron."

"I can't."

"Tell me about the song, then. The one you're writing. The one about Lanre."

She was quiet for a long moment. The fountain murmured between us, filling the silence with its endless whisper.

"The song isn't mine," she said finally. "It never was. I'm just... the instrument. The voice that gives it form."

"Whose song is it?"

"Someone who's been waiting a very long time to have it sung." She stood, walked to the edge of the fountain, trailed her fingers through the water. "Someone who believes that words can change the world. That the right story, told in the right way, can remake everything."

"That sounds dangerous."

"It is dangerous." She turned to face me, and there was something desperate in her expression. "Kvothe, I—there are things I want to tell you. Things I need you to know. But every time I try, the words just... slip away. Like they were never there."

"The braids."

She touched her hair instinctively. "You noticed."

"I've been learning to read Yllish. Some of it." I stood, moved closer. "There are patterns in your hair. Bindings. Commands."

"I know." Her voice was very small. "I've tried to remove them. But every time I do, I forget why I wanted to. And then I find myself braiding them back in, without remembering when I started."

"Who taught you to braid them?"

"My patron." The words came slowly, as if dragged from somewhere deep. "He said it was protection. Said it would keep me safe from the people who wanted to hurt me. But now I'm not sure..." She swayed, caught herself on the fountain's edge. "I'm not sure if he was protecting me, or if he was just making sure I couldn't run."

"Denna—"

"Don't." She held up a hand, and I saw tears on her cheeks. "Don't try to save me, Kvothe. You can't. You don't understand what's happening. What's been set in motion."

"Then help me understand."

"I can't." The words broke on a sob. "That's what I'm trying to tell you. I physically cannot. The words won't come. The thoughts slip away. I'm trapped inside my own head, watching myself do things I don't want to do, and I can't stop."

She fled before I could respond—vanished into the shadows of the garden like a ghost, like a dream, like everything I'd ever loved slipping through my fingers.

I stood alone by the fountain for a long time, watching the moon's reflection fracture and reform on the water's surface.

"That was when you knew," Chronicler said. "That she was being controlled."

"I'd suspected before. But that night—seeing the fear in her eyes, the way she fought against the bindings—I knew for certain." The innkeeper's voice was hollow. "She was a prisoner inside her own mind. And the man who held the keys was using her to destroy everything I cared about."

"Why didn't you act? Go after her patron directly?"

"I tried. Gods help me, I tried." He laughed—a bitter sound. "But Cinder is older than nations. Cleverer than anything I'd ever faced. Every move I made, he'd anticipated. Every trap I set, he'd already disarmed."

"So what did you do?"

"I waited. I watched. I learned everything I could about Yllish magic and binding and the ways that words could control the mind." The cloth went still in his hands. "And when I finally understood enough to help her—when I finally had a plan that might have worked—"

"It was too late."

"It was too late." He set down the cloth. "The song was already written. The performance was already planned. And Denna was already so deep inside the binding that she didn't even know who she was anymore."

"Just an instrument."

"Just an instrument." His voice cracked. "Playing a song that would crack the world open."
